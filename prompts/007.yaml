    The man was very poor and lived in a small, cramped house with his wife and children. He worked hard to try to provide for his family, but it was never enough. The man felt like he was failing his family and was constantly worried about money.

    One day, the man came across a large sum of money. He was ecstatic and immediately thought of all the things he could do with the money. He could buy his family a new house, send his children to school, and finally provide for them the way he always wanted to.
