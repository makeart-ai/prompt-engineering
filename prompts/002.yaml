    I was addicted to love. I had to have it. I needed it. I craved it. I couldn't get enough of it.

    I would fall in love with anyone who would give me the time of day. I was always in a relationship, always searching for that next high. The rush of falling in love was unlike anything else I had ever experienced.

    I was always chasing that first high, that first rush of adrenaline and dopamine that came with falling in love. But it was never as good as the first time. The first time was always the best.

    I would often find myself in relationships that were toxic, that were harmful to me. But I couldn't help myself. I needed the love, even if it was bad for me.

    I would often find myself in love with someone who didn't love me back. I would chase after them, trying to convince them to love me. But it was never enough. I always wanted more.

    I was addicted to love. And it was destroying me.

    Lars was addicted to love. He was addicted to the feeling of being in love. He craved the intensity, the passion, the all-consuming fire of love. He was always searching for his next fix, his next hit of love.

    Lars had been in and out of relationships for as long as he could remember. He had been married twice, and had countless girlfriends in between. He had always been drawn to women who were damaged in some way, who needed rescuing. He liked to think of himself as a knight in shining armor, riding in to save the damsel in distress.

    But saving damsels was not always as romantic as it sounded. Lars had a tendency to get too involved, to try to fix things that were beyond his control. He would swoop in, try to fix the relationship, and then when things inevitably fell apart, he would be left feeling shattered and broken.

    Lars was currently single, and he was starting to feel the itch, the craving for love again. He had been single for almost a year now, and he was starting to feel like he couldn't take it anymore. He needed to find someone, to fall in love again.

    It was one of those days where everything felt off. The sun was too bright, the sky too blue, the birds too chirpy. Even the air felt thick and cloying. It was the kind of day that made you want to crawl back into bed and hide under the covers.

    For most people, that would have been the end of it. But for the main character in this story, it was just the beginning.

    The main character, we'll call her Sarah, was a love addict. For her, days like this were a special kind of torture. She was hyper-aware of all the love and happiness around her, and it made her feel even more alone.

    Sarah had been in and out of relationships for as long as she could remember. She was always the one who got too attached too quickly, who fell hard and fast and then got hurt just as quickly. She was always the one who was left behind when the other person moved on.

    But Sarah didn't see it that way. To her, each relationship was real and true and beautiful. Even when it ended in pain, she cherished the memories and held onto the hope that someday, she would find the one who would love her the

    Nina had always been a bit of a love addict. She loved the feeling of being in love, and she loved the attention and adoration that came along with it. She was always on the lookout for her next fix, and she had a long list of ex-boyfriends to show for it.

    Her current boyfriend, Alex, was the latest in a long line of conquests. She had been with him for a few months, and she was already getting bored. She knew that it was only a matter of time before she moved on to someone new.

    She's standing in front of the bathroom mirror, naked. Her body is covered in cuts and bruises. Some of them are fresh, still seeping blood. Others are old and healed over.

    She looks at herself dispassionately, taking in the damage. It's all she can see anymore, whenever she looks at herself. The damage. The wounds.

    She turns on the tap and starts to clean herself off. It's a painstaking process, cleaning each wound gently so as not to reopen it. She knows from experience that even the smallest of cuts can get infected and become something much worse.

    Once she's finished, she applies a thin layer of antiseptic cream to all of her cuts and bruises. Then she gets dressed and goes about her day.

    This is her life now. Constantly nursing her wounds, both physical and emotional. She's a love addict, and she can't help herself. She's addicted to the highs and lows of love, even though she knows it's destroying her.

    But she can't stop. She's addicted to the rush of adrenaline that comes with falling in love. She's addicted to the way her heart feels when it's soaring with happiness. And she's addicted

    "I'm sorry, miss, but you're going to have to put those away."

    I turned around, and saw the store clerk pointing at my cigarettes. I had forgotten that smoking was not allowed inside the store.

    "I'm sorry," I said, sheepishly. "I didn't see the sign."

    I put the cigarettes away, and hurried out of the store. I was so embarrassed that I didn't even look at the man behind me again. I was sure that he must have been laughing at me.

    I got home and sat down on the couch, trying to forget about the incident at the store. But I couldn't help but wonder what the man behind me had thought of me. Was he laughing at me? Or did he feel sorry for me?

    I grabbed a pack of cigarettes off the shelf and went to the counter to pay. Jake was behind me in line and we started talking. We flirted a little and I could tell he was interested in me.

    I paid for my cigarettes and we walked out of the store together. Jake asked if I wanted to go for a walk and I said yes. We ended up at the park and sat down on a bench. We talked and kissed for a while and I started to feel things I hadn't felt in a long time.

    I started to make small talk, and he was friendly. I asked him what he was doing in the store, and he said he was just getting some dinner for himself. We talked for a few more minutes, and I invited him to come over for dinner. He accepted.

    I was so happy. I had butterflies in my stomach the whole way home. I was going to have dinner with the most handsome man I had ever seen.

    When I got home, I started to cook dinner. I was so nervous, I could barely focus on what I was doing. I was chopping vegetables when I heard a knock at the door. I ran to answer it, and there he was.

    I had a feeling that something was going to happen at the new Walmart. But I went anyway. And sure enough, as soon as I walked in, I saw him. Right there in the produce section, picking out a bunch of bananas. It was him, the love of my life, the man I had been obsessed with for years.

    I tried to play it cool, but I could feel my heart racing. I Pretended to browse the nearby shelves, but I couldn't take my eyes off him. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore. I had to talk to him.

    "Excuse me, do you mind if I ask what you're doing here?" I said, trying to sound casual.

    He looked surprised, but he smiled and said, "I'm just doing some shopping."

    "Oh, I see. I'm just surprised to see you here, that's all."

    "Why? Do you live nearby?" he asked.

    "Yes, I do. I live just down the road," I said. "I'm surprised we haven't run into each other before."

    It’s hard to remember it sometimes. I was given it a long time ago, in another life. I was a different person then. I go by Daisy now. It’s easier that way.

    I met her at one of my AA meetings. I was new then, fresh out of rehab and looking for any way to stay clean. She was my sponsor. At first, I was just grateful to have someone to help me through the tough times. But then, I started to fall for her.

    I was lovesick, addicted to her presence. I couldn’t get enough. I would do anything to make her happy. I would have done anything for her. And that’s how I ended up here.

    I’m in prison now, serving a life sentence. I killed her husband. I didn’t mean to, but I was so jealous of him. I couldn’t stand to see her with him. I wanted her all to myself.

    Now, I sit in my cell every day, regretting what I did. I ruined my life and hers. And I’ll never be able to see her again.

    It feels like a trap, like if I say my real name they'll know who I am and what I've done. But I can't keep lying, not anymore. I'm tired of all the deception. So I take a deep breath and say, "My name is Nadia."

    Nadia is a love addict. She's been in and out of relationships for as long as she can remember, always searching for that one person who will make her feel complete. But it's never enough. The high of a new relationship always wears off, and she's left feeling empty and alone.

    Nadia's addiction has led her to do some things she's not proud of. She's cheated, lied, and stolen. She's even hurt the people she's supposed to love the most. But she can't help it. She's addicted to the Rush of a new relationship, and she'll do anything to get her fix.

    Now, Nadia is alone and facing the consequences of her actions. She's lost the trust of her family and friends, and she's not sure if she can ever go back. But she's determined to get help, to face her addiction head-on. Because she knows that, deep down, she

    But no, I had to go to the one next to the Starbucks, even though it's always so crowded. I was in the middle of picking out my produce when I saw her. I couldn't believe it. She was actually there, in the same grocery store as me.

    I tried to act casual, but I couldn't take my eyes off her. She was so beautiful. I wanted to talk to her, but I didn't want to seem like a creep. So I just followed her around the store, hoping she would notice me. But she didn't. She just went about her business, completely oblivious to the fact that I was even there.

    Finally, I couldn't take it anymore. I had to talk to her. I walked up to her and tapped her on the shoulder. She turned around, and I was lost in her eyes. "Hi," I said. "I'm sorry to bother you, but I couldn't help but notice you. You're really beautiful."

    She smiled. "Thank you. I'm flattered."

    We started talking, and I soon found out that her name was Sarah. We talked for a few minutes, and I invited her to grab a cup of coffee with me

    But as I looked closer, I realized that it was a human hand, severed at the wrist and lying in the gutter. I felt my stomach turn.

    I was about to call the police when I saw a man walking towards me, a panicked look on his face. He was holding his other hand behind his back, and I could see blood seeping through his fingers.

    "Please," he said, "help me. I've been attacked."

    I took him to the hospital, where he told me his story. He was a love addict, he said, and he had been seeing a woman who he thought was the one for him. But she had rejected him, and in a fit of rage, he had attacked her with a knife.

    "I didn't mean to hurt her," he said, his eyes filled with tears. "I just wanted her to love me."

    I couldn't imagine the pain and loneliness that must have driven him to such desperate measures. I wished I could tell him that there was someone out there who loved him, but I didn't know if that was true.

I ignored it, but it persisted. eventually, I got up to investigate and found a small, black cat scratching at my door, mewing to be let in. I picked it up and brought it inside, and it immediately made itself at home.

    I named the cat Cookie, and we became fast friends. She was always there when I came home, and I started talking to her like she was a person. I told her all about my day, and she would listen attentively. I even started cooking for her, making sure to include a can of cat food in my grocery list.

    But then one day, I came home and Cookie wasn't there to greet me. I called her name, but there was no answer. I looked for her everywhere, but she was nowhere to be found. I even put up missing posters, but no one had seen her. I was devastated.

    A few weeks later, I was out walking and I saw a black cat that looked just like Cookie. I called her name, and to my amazement, she came running to me. I scooped her up and took her home, and

    I was always a bit of a loner, never really fitting in with any particular group. So when I met James, I was ecstatic. Finally, I had found someone who understood me. We bonded over our shared love of books and movies and quickly became inseparable. I thought I had found my soulmate. 

    But then, things changed. James started to become possessive, demanding to know who I was talking to and where I was going. He would get angry if I didn't answer his calls or respond to his texts right away. I tried to talk to him about it, but he would just laugh it off and say I was being paranoid. 

    Eventually, I stopped talking to my friends and family altogether. I was too afraid of what James might say or do. I became a shell of my former self, existing only to please James. And then, one day, I couldn't take it anymore. I packed my bags and left.

    I was born in Moscow, but I grew up in New York. My parents are Russian immigrants who came to America in the early 1990s. They didn't have much money, so we always lived in small apartments in bad neighborhoods. But I was happy. I had a loving family and I was doing well in school.
    Everything changed when I was sixteen. That's when I met him. His name was Sergey and he was twenty-one. He was charming and handsome and I was instantly smitten. Sergey was my first everything. My first love, my first kiss, my first sexual experience.
    I gave myself to him completely. I would do anything he asked me to do. I was totally in love with him and I thought he loved me too.
    But Sergey only wanted one thing from me: sex. Whenever we were together, that's all he would want to do. And if I refused, he would get angry. Really angry. He would call me names, hit me, and even threaten to kill me.
    I was scared of him, but I couldn't leave him. I didn't know how to get out of the situation I was in.
    Then, one night, Sergey took me to a party at one of his friends' houses. There were other people there, some of them older than him. I didn't know any of them.
    Sergey told me to go upstairs to one of the bedrooms with one of the men. He said it would be fun. I was scared, but I didn't want to disappoint him.
    So I went with the man. And he raped me.
    I screamed and fought, but it was no use. The man was too strong. When he was finished, he just got up and walked out of the room, leaving me there alone.
    I was in shock. I couldn't believe what had just happened. I wanted to die.
    But Sergey wasn't done with me yet. He came into the room and started to yell at me. He said it was my fault that the man had raped me. He said I had led him on

    But Sergey wasn't done with me yet. He came into the room and started to yell at me. He said it was my fault that the man had raped me. He said I had led him on. Then he told me that if I ever wanted to see him again, I would have to go through with it. He said I would have to have sex with all the men who were at the party.
    I started to cry and tried to reason with him. But it didn't work. He pushed me to the floor and kicked me in the stomach. Then he left the room and locked the door behind him.
    The next thing I knew, all the men were coming into the bedroom. One after the other, they raped me. They hit me and spit on me and called me the worst names. I tried to fight back, but I was no match for them. And all I could see was the image of Sergey's face laughing at me while they were hurting me.
    After they were finished with me, they left me bleeding, naked and alone on the bedroom floor. I stayed there for hours before I finally mustered up the strength to get up. My whole body ached, but I could barely even feel the pain anymore. My mind was numb. Everything I knew about my life and the world had been shattered.
    I knew I couldn't go back home to my family. Not after what had happened. They would never believe me. They would call me a liar and a slut, just like Sergey and all the other men. My father would probably kill me.
    I stumbled out of the house and staggered down the street in a daze. I wasn't sure where I was going. I only knew that I had to get away and I could never go back.
    I walked and walked, until I couldn't walk anymore. My body was covered in bruises and cuts. I found a phone booth and called the police.
    They took me to the nearest hospital. The doctor said I had internal injuries and would need an MRI. The test was administered the next morning. It showed that I had suffered a severe concussion and I had an inflamed bladder. I was in pain and could barely talk, but I didn't have to say anything. The police could tell what had happened to me.
    At the police station, I told them about Sergey and the rape. They listened and asked questions. They even called my father. He was in tears, but I knew he was only acting. He would never really care about me.
    In the end, the police stayed with me at the hospital for three days. They brought me food and water and even bought me a set of comfortable pajamas. They never left my side. They said they would do everything they could to protect me. But I knew that no matter what happened, I was all alone.

    But Sergey wasn't done with me yet. He came into the room and started to yell at me. He said it was my fault that the man had raped me. He said I had led him on. He said it was my punishment for disappointing him.
    As I lay there sobbing on the floor, I realized that Sergey was the one who had done this to me. He had tricked me into sleeping with a man who had raped me. I was mad. So mad.
    The next time I saw Sergey, I told him I never wanted to see him or talk to him again. But this just made him angry. He didn't want me to leave.
    So Sergey threatened to tell my parents about the rape if I tried to leave him.
    I didn't know what to do.
    I couldn't tell my parents about it. My parents are from Russia, but they're very traditional. They think a girl's virginity is her most important quality. They've told me many times that a girl who loses her virginity before she's married is useless. They won't even let me talk to boys.
    I kept thinking, what would my parents do if they found out that I had been raped? They would think that I was worthless. They would be ashamed of me. They would probably think I deserved it.
    After talking to Sergey, I tried to forget what had happened. I tried to move on with my life and pretend like nothing had happened. But I couldn't do it. I started getting depressed and having suicidal thoughts. I didn't want to live.
    One day I decided to take an overdose of pills. I just wanted it all to end.
    But then I saw a text message from Sergey on my phone. It said, "I'm sorry about what happened. I love you."
    And that's when it hit me: Sergey had done this to me on purpose and he was trying to trick me into thinking he loved me. But he didn't love me. He didn't even care about me. He just wanted to control me.
    Suddenly I knew I had to get out of this situation. I had to escape.
    I climbed into a suitcase, put some clothes and an ID on top of me, and told my roommate that I'd gone out for a few hours. My roommate didn't notice that the suitcase was heavier than usual, so she put it in the trunk of her car and drove me to the airport.
    As soon as my roommate left and no one else was around, I climbed out of the suitcase and bought a ticket. I had a fake ID and enough money to get somewhere far away from Sergey and my parents.
    I flew to Colorado and got a job as a waitress and started living under the name Nadia. My life was finally starting to get better. I was healing, both physically and emotionally. I even started dating a nice guy named James.
    But I was still scared. I kept thinking that Sergey would track me down and find me. Then, a couple of months ago, I met a woman named Martha. Martha told me that the only way I could truly escape Sergey would be to become a different person. Martha told me that she could create new documents for me. New documents with a new name and a new identity. She said she would do it for free.
    I was scared to trust Martha at first. But she seemed so nice and I had nowhere else to turn. So I let her create new documents for me. Documents that said my name was Nadia Karlsson.
    I've been Nadia Karlsson for three months now. Besides James, I haven't told anyone my secret.

    The next thing I knew, all the men were coming into the bedroom. One after the other, they raped me. They hit me and spit on me and called me the worst names. I tried to fight back, but I was no match for them. And all I could see was the image of Sergey's face laughing at me while they were hurting me.
    After they were finished with me, they left me bleeding, naked and alone on the bedroom floor. I stayed there for hours before I finally mustered up the strength to get up. My whole body ached, but I could barely even feel the pain anymore. My mind was numb. Everything I knew about my life and the world had been shattered.
    I knew I couldn't go back home to my family. Not after what had happened. They would never believe me. They would call me a liar and a slut, just like Sergey and all the other men. My father would probably kill me.
    I stumbled out of the house and staggered down the street in a daze. I wasn't sure where I was going. I only knew that I had to get away and I could never go back.
    I walked and walked, until I couldn't walk anymore. My body was covered in bruises and cuts. I found a phone booth and called the police.
    They took me to the nearest hospital. The doctor said I had internal injuries and would need an MRI. The test was administered the next morning. It showed that I had suffered a severe concussion and I had an inflamed bladder. I was in pain and could barely talk, but I didn't have to say anything. The police could tell what had happened to me.
    At the police station, I told them about Sergey and the rape. They listened and asked questions. They even called my father. He was in tears, but I knew he was only acting. He would never really care about me.
    The next day, the police took me to the precinct to file a formal report. There, I had to tell my story in front of a room full of people. It was humiliating. After I was done, I cried for hours.
    No one believed me. They thought my whole story was a lie.
    They said that I had obviously given my consent to the men and only regretted it afterwards. They said that I was just a slut and a whore who couldn't handle the consequences of casual sex with strangers.
    But the whole thing had been a setup. They had lured me there with the promise of a good time. They had raped me in a bedroom under the supervision of Sergey.
    All this was ignored by the police and the district attorney. No one was interested in fighting for justice. So, I realized that justice was something I would have to fight for myself.
    I decided to leave my life behind. I swore that I would never show my face to anyone again and I would never speak to another man.
    I left the state with just the clothes on my back. I found a small town on the other side of the country, in the middle of nowhere. There, I created a new identity, a new meaning to my life.
    But things did not go as planned. My family eventually found me and I was forced to go back home.
    That's when I came here.
    Coming here was the hardest thing I had ever done. I didn't know what to expect or what I would find. But I had nothing left to lose.
    I don't know if I can ever go back to the life I had before. I don't know if it's even possible to overcome what I have been through.
    But at least now I can see that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. I can see that there is somebody who cares about me.
    I still don't know if it will all work out. But at least now I have hope.
    Epilogue
    Thanks for reading my story.
    I wrote this story because I know what it's like to feel like there's no one that cares about you. I know what it's like to feel like your life has no worth.
    If you ever feel that way, please know that there are people out there who do care about you. I know it doesn't seem like it right now, but it's the truth.
    Please never give up. Please never stop fighting. No matter how hard things get, there's always something that you can do to make your life better.
    I know what it's like to feel lost and alone. But I also know that there's a way out of that darkness. Just keep trying and you'll find it.

    When they ask my name, I pause. It feels like a trap, like if I say my real name they'll know who I am and what I've done. But I can't keep lying, not anymore. I'm tired of all the deception. So I take a deep breath and say, "My name is Nadia."
    Nadia is not my real name, but it's close enough. And it's the name I've been using for the past year, ever since I ran away from home. I changed my name to Nadia because it means "hope" in Russian. And I needed hope. I needed something to believe in.
    I was born in Moscow, but I grew up in New York. My parents are Russian immigrants who came to America in the early 1990s. They didn't have much money, so we always lived in small apartments in bad neighborhoods. But I was happy. I had a loving family and I was doing well in school.
    Everything changed when I was sixteen. That's when I met him. His name was Sergey and he was twenty-one. He was charming and handsome and I was instantly smitten. Sergey was my first everything. My first love, my first kiss, my first sexual experience.
    I gave myself to him completely. I would do anything he asked me to do. I was totally in love with him and I thought he loved me too.
    But Sergey only wanted one thing from me: sex. Whenever we were together, that's all he would want to do. And if I refused, he would get angry. Really angry. He would call me names, hit me, and even threaten to kill me.
    I was scared of him, but I couldn't leave him. I didn't know how to get out of the situation I was in.
    Then, one night, Sergey took me to a party at one of his friends' houses. There were other people there, some of them older than him. I didn't know any of them.
    Sergey told me to go upstairs to one of the bedrooms with one of the men. He said it would be fun. I was scared, but I didn't want to disappoint him.
    So I went with the man. And he raped me.
    I screamed and fought, but it was no use. The man was too strong. When he was finished, he just got up and walked out of the room, leaving me there alone.
    I was in shock. I couldn't believe what had just happened. I wanted to die.
    But Sergey wasn't done with me yet. He came into the room and started to yell at me. He said it was my fault that the man had raped me. He said I had led him on. Then he told me that if I ever wanted to see him again, I would have to go through with it. He said I would have to have sex with all the men who were at the party.
    I started to cry and tried to reason with him. But it didn't work. He pushed me to the floor and kicked me in the stomach. Then he left the room and locked the door behind him.

    At my father came to the police station, he wasn't alone. He was with my brothers, who looked very angry. When he saw them, one of the police officers told me to go into the next room. I listened to what sounded like a heated argument, although I couldn't understand what they were saying. When I came out of the room, I saw my father and brothers get into a black limousine and drive away. The police looked at me and said I was free to go. 
    I went outside and saw the limousine parked across the street. My father and brothers were sitting inside, smoking and looking straight ahead. I walked over to the car and knocked on the window. They looked up at me and laughed. My father rolled the window down. 
    "Get in," he said. I got into the back seat. 
    "Where are we going?" I asked. 
    "Back home," he said. 
    "Home? But I can't go home. Why are you acting like this never happened? I'm telling you, I was raped! Why won't you believe me?" 
    "Listen, Nadia. You might think you were raped, but it wasn't rape." 
    "But-" 
    "No, listen to me! Men have needs. They have urges. It's natural for them to want sex sometimes. They can't help it. And when they have those urges, it's up to women to satisfy them. " 
    "But I-" 
    "That's the way it's always been! If you didn't want this to happen, maybe you shouldn't have been such a slut. Now sit back in your seat and be quiet. We're almost home." 
    I didn't say anything. I kept quiet for the rest of the drive. I couldn't hold back my tears though. They were streaming down my face. 
    When we got to our apartment, my father told me to stay in the living room while they went upstairs to talk. While they were upstairs, I grabbed my backpack and stuffed money, clothes, and anything else I could find inside it. I quickly put on my jacket and left the house. I didn't know if they were watching me, but I wasn't coming back anyway. 
    I took a taxi to a nearby bus station and bought a ticket to Los Angeles. It didn't matter where I was going; I just needed to get away from my family. I boarded the bus and rode it for hours. I was exhausted, but I couldn't sleep. All I could think about was what had happened to me, and what my father had said in the car. 
    When I finally fell asleep, I had a nightmare. In my dream I saw Sergey and all the men at the party. They were all leering at me, with lust in their eyes. They were about to rape me again. I tried to run, but I couldn't move. I was paralyzed with fear. I wanted to yell for help, but I couldn't make any noise. I was trapped there and all I could do was stare into their eyes as they attacked me. 
    I woke up with a start. I looked around and realized that the bus had stopped. I saw the driver getting off, so I ran after him. "Where are we?" I asked him. He pointed to a sign that said, "Los Angeles City Limits." "We must have just entered the city," he said. "Is this where you wanted to go?" "I don't know anymore," I said. "Yeah, this is where I want to go."

While they were upstairs, I grabbed my backpack and stuffed money, clothes, and anything else I could find inside it. I quickly put on my jacket and left the house. I didn't know if they were watching me, but I wasn't coming back anyway. 
    I took a taxi to a nearby bus station and bought a ticket to Los Angeles. It didn't matter where I was going; I just needed to get away from my family. I boarded the bus and rode it for hours. I was exhausted, but I couldn't sleep. All I could think about was what had happened to me, and what my father had said in the car. 
    When I finally fell asleep, I had a nightmare. In my dream I saw Sergey and all the men at the party. They were all leering at me, with lust in their eyes. They were about to rape me again. I tried to run, but I couldn't move. I was paralyzed with fear. I wanted to yell for help, but I couldn't make any noise. I was trapped there and all I could do was stare into their eyes as they attacked me. 
    I woke up with a start. I looked around and realized that the bus had stopped. I saw the driver getting off, so I ran after him. "Where are we?" I asked him. He pointed to a sign that said, "Los Angeles City Limits." "We must have just entered the city," he said. "Is this where you wanted to go?" "I don't know anymore," I said. "Yeah, this is where I want to go."

    When they ask my name, I pause. It feels like a trap, like if I say my real name they'll know who I am and what I've done. But I can't keep lying, not anymore. I'm tired of all the deception. So I take a deep breath and say, "My name is Nadia."
    Nadia is not my real name, but it's close enough. And it's the name I've been using for the past year, ever since I ran away from home. I changed my name to Nadia because it means "hope" in Russian. And I needed hope. I needed something to believe in.
    I was born in Moscow, but I grew up in New York. My parents are Russian immigrants who came to America in the early 1990s. They didn't have much money, so we always lived in small apartments in bad neighborhoods. But I was happy. I had a loving family and I was doing well in school.
    Everything changed when I was sixteen. That's when I met him. His name was Sergey and he was twenty-one. He was charming and handsome and I was instantly smitten. Sergey was my first everything. My first love, my first kiss, my first sexual experience.
    I gave myself to him completely. I would do anything he asked me to do. I was totally in love with him and I thought he loved me too.
    But Sergey only wanted one thing from me: sex. Whenever we were together, that's all he would want to do. And if I refused, he would get angry. Really angry. He would call me names, hit me, and even threaten to kill me.
    I was scared of him, but I couldn't leave him. I didn't know how to get out of the situation I was in.
    Then, one night, Sergey took me to a party at one of his friends' houses. There were other people there, some of them older than him. I didn't know any of them.
    Sergey told me to go upstairs to one of the bedrooms with one of the men. He said it would be fun. I was scared, but I didn't want to disappoint him.
    So I went with the man. And he raped me.
    I screamed and fought, but it was no use. The man was too strong. When he was finished, he just got up and walked out of the room, leaving me there alone.
    I was in shock. I couldn't believe what had just happened. I wanted to die.
    But Sergey wasn't done with me yet. He came into the room and started to yell at me. He said it was my fault that the man had raped me. He said I had led him on. Then he told me that if I ever wanted to see him again, I would have to go through with it. He said I would have to have sex with all the men who were at the party.
    I started to cry and tried to reason with him. But it didn't work. He pushed me to the floor and kicked me in the stomach. Then he left the room and locked the door behind him.
    The next thing I knew, all the men were coming into the bedroom. One after the other, they raped me. They hit me and spit on me and called me the worst names. I tried to fight back, but I was no match for them. And all I could see was the image of Sergey's face laughing at me while they were hurting me.
    After they were finished with me, they left me bleeding, naked and alone on the bedroom floor. I stayed there for hours before I finally mustered up the strength to get up. My whole body ached, but I could barely even feel the pain anymore. My mind was numb. Everything I knew about my life and the world had been shattered.
    I knew I couldn't go back home to my family. Not after what had happened. They would never believe me. They would call me a liar and a slut, just like Sergey and all the other men. My father would probably kill me.
    I stumbled out of the house and staggered down the street in a daze. I wasn't sure where I was going. I only knew that I had to get away and I could never go back.
    I walked and walked, until I couldn't walk anymore. My body was covered in bruises and cuts. I found a phone booth and called the police.
    They took me to the nearest hospital. The doctor said I had internal injuries and would need an MRI. The test was administered the next morning. It showed that I had suffered a severe concussion and I had an inflamed bladder. I was in pain and could barely talk, but I didn't have to say anything. The police could tell what had happened to me.
    At the police station, I told them about Sergey and the rape. They listened and asked questions. They even called my father. He was in tears, but I knew he was only acting. He would never really care about me.
    At my father came to the police station, he wasn't alone. He was with my brothers, who looked very angry. When he saw them, one of the police officers told me to go into the next room. I listened to what sounded like a heated argument, although I couldn't understand what they were saying. When I came out of the room, I saw my father and brothers get into a black limousine and drive away. The police looked at me and said I was free to go. 
    I went outside and saw the limousine parked across the street. My father and brothers were sitting inside, smoking and looking straight ahead. I walked over to the car and knocked on the window. They looked up at me and laughed. My father rolled the window down. 
    "Get in," he said. I got into the back seat. 
    "Where are we going?" I asked. 
    "Back home," he said. 
    "Home? But I can't go home. Why are you acting like this never happened? I'm telling you, I was raped! Why won't you believe me?" 
    "Listen, Nadia. You might think you were raped, but it wasn't rape." 
    "But-" 
    "No, listen to me! Men have needs. They have urges. It's natural for them to want sex sometimes. They can't help it. And when they have those urges, it's up to women to satisfy them. " 
    "But I-" 
    "That's the way it's always been! If you didn't want this to happen, maybe you shouldn't have been such a slut. Now sit back in your seat and be quiet. We're almost home." 
    I didn't say anything. I kept quiet for the rest of the drive. I couldn't hold back my tears though. They were streaming down my face. 
    When we got to our apartment, my father told me to stay in the living room while they went upstairs to talk.

    "That's the way it's always been! If you didn't want this to happen, maybe you shouldn't have been such a slut. Now sit back in your seat and be quiet. We're almost home." 
    I didn't say anything. I kept quiet for the rest of the drive. I couldn't hold back my tears though. They were streaming down my face. 
    When we got to our apartment, my father told me to stay in the living room while they went upstairs to talk. While they were upstairs, I grabbed my backpack and stuffed money, clothes, and anything else I could find inside it. I quickly put on my jacket and left the house. I didn't know if they were watching me, but I wasn't coming back anyway. 
    I took a taxi to a nearby bus station and bought a ticket to Los Angeles. It didn't matter where I was going; I just needed to get away from my family. I boarded the bus and rode it for hours. I was exhausted, but I couldn't sleep. All I could think about was what had happened to me, and what my father had said in the car. 
    When I finally fell asleep, I had a nightmare. In my dream I saw Sergey and all the men at the party. They were all leering at me, with lust in their eyes. They were about to rape me again. I tried to run, but I couldn't move. I was paralyzed with fear. I wanted to yell for help, but I couldn't make any noise. I was trapped there and all I could do was stare into their eyes as they attacked me. 
    I woke up with a start. I looked around and realized that the bus had stopped. I saw the driver getting off, so I ran after him. "Where are we?" I asked him. He pointed to a sign that said, "Los Angeles City Limits." "We must have just entered the city," he said. "Is this where you wanted to go?" "I don't know anymore," I said. "Yeah, this is where I want to go."

    When they ask my name, I pause. It feels like a trap, like if I say my real name they'll know who I am and what I've done. But I can't keep lying, not anymore. I'm tired of all the deception. So I take a deep breath and say, "My name is Nadia."
    Nadia is not my real name, but it's close enough. And it's the name I've been using for the past year, ever since I ran away from home. I changed my name to Nadia because it means "hope" in Russian. And I needed hope. I needed something to believe in.
    I was born in Moscow, but I grew up in New York. My parents are Russian immigrants who came to America in the early 1990s. They didn't have much money, so we always lived in small apartments in bad neighborhoods. But I was happy. I had a loving family and I was doing well in school.
    Everything changed when I was sixteen. That's when I met him. His name was Sergey and he was twenty-one. He was charming and handsome and I was instantly smitten. Sergey was my first everything. My first love, my first kiss, my first sexual experience.
    I gave myself to him completely. I would do anything he asked me to do. I was totally in love with him and I thought he loved me too.
    But Sergey only wanted one thing from me: sex. Whenever we were together, that's all he would want to do. And if I refused, he would get angry. Really angry. He would call me names, hit me, and even threaten to kill me.
    I was scared of him, but I couldn't leave him. I didn't know how to get out of the situation I was in.
    Then, one night, Sergey took me to a party at one of his friends' houses. There were other people there, some of them older than him. I didn't know any of them.
    Sergey told me to go upstairs to one of the bedrooms with one of the men. He said it would be fun. I was scared, but I didn't want to disappoint him.
    So I went with the man. And he raped me.
    I screamed and fought, but it was no use. The man was too strong. When he was finished, he just got up and walked out of the room, leaving me there alone.
    I was in shock. I couldn't believe what had just happened. I wanted to die.
    But Sergey wasn't done with me yet. He came into the room and started to yell at me. He said it was my fault that the man had raped me. He said I had led him on. Then he told me that if I ever wanted to see him again, I would have to go through with it. He said I would have to have sex with all the men who were at the party.
    I started to cry and tried to reason with him. But it didn't work. He pushed me to the floor and kicked me in the stomach. Then he left the room and locked the door behind him.
    The next thing I knew, all the men were coming into the bedroom. One after the other, they raped me. They hit me and spit on me and called me the worst names. I tried to fight back, but I was no match for them. And all I could see was the image of Sergey's face laughing at me while they were hurting me.
    After they were finished with me, they left me bleeding, naked and alone on the bedroom floor. I stayed there for hours before I finally mustered up the strength to get up. My whole body ached, but I could barely even feel the pain anymore. My mind was numb. Everything I knew about my life and the world had been shattered.
    I knew I couldn't go back home to my family. Not after what had happened. They would never believe me. They would call me a liar and a slut, just like Sergey and all the other men. My father would probably kill me.
    I stumbled out of the house and staggered down the street in a daze. I wasn't sure where I was going. I only knew that I had to get away and I could never go back.
    I walked and walked, until I couldn't walk anymore. My body was covered in bruises and cuts. I found a phone booth and called the police.
    They took me to the nearest hospital. The doctor said I had internal injuries and would need an MRI. The test was administered the next morning. It showed that I had suffered a severe concussion and I had an inflamed bladder. I was in pain and could barely talk, but I didn't have to say anything. The police could tell what had happened to me.
    At the police station, I told them about Sergey and the rape. They listened and asked questions. They even called my father. He was in tears, but I knew he was only acting. He would never really care about me.
    At my father came to the police station, he wasn't alone. He was with my brothers, who looked very angry. When he saw them, one of the police officers told me to go into the next room. I listened to what sounded like a heated argument, although I couldn't understand what they were saying. When I came out of the room, I saw my father and brothers get into a black limousine and drive away. The police looked at me and said I was free to go. 
    I went outside and saw the limousine parked across the street. My father and brothers were sitting inside, smoking and looking straight ahead. I walked over to the car and knocked on the window. They looked up at me and laughed. My father rolled the window down. 
    "Get in," he said. I got into the back seat. 
    "Where are we going?" I asked. 
    "Back home," he said. 
    "Home? But I can't go home. Why are you acting like this never happened? I'm telling you, I was raped! Why won't you believe me?" 
    "Listen, Nadia. You might think you were raped, but it wasn't rape." 
    "But-" 
    "No, listen to me! Men have needs. They have urges. It's natural for them to want sex sometimes. They can't help it. And when they have those urges, it's up to women to satisfy them. "

    "But I-" 
    "That's the way it's always been! If you didn't want this to happen, maybe you shouldn't have been such a slut. Now sit back in your seat and be quiet. We're almost home." 
    I didn't say anything. I kept quiet for the rest of the drive. I couldn't hold back my tears though. They were streaming down my face. 
    When we got to our apartment, my father told me to stay in the living room while they went upstairs to talk. While they were upstairs, I grabbed my backpack and stuffed money, clothes, and anything else I could find inside it. I quickly put on my jacket and left the house. I didn't know if they were watching me, but I wasn't coming back anyway. 
    I took a taxi to a nearby bus station and bought a ticket to Los Angeles. It didn't matter where I was going; I just needed to get away from my family. I boarded the bus and rode it for hours. I was exhausted, but I couldn't sleep. All I could think about was what had happened to me, and what my father had said in the car. 
    When I finally fell asleep, I had a nightmare. In my dream I saw Sergey and all the men at the party. They were all leering at me, with lust in their eyes. They were about to rape me again. I tried to run, but I couldn't move. I was paralyzed with fear. I wanted to yell for help, but I couldn't make any noise. I was trapped there and all I could do was stare into their eyes as they attacked me. 
    I woke up with a start. I looked around and realized that the bus had stopped. I saw the driver getting off, so I ran after him. "Where are we?" I asked him. He pointed to a sign that said, "Los Angeles City Limits." "We must have just entered the city," he said. "Is this where you wanted to go?" "I don't know anymore," I said. "Yeah, this is where I want to go."
