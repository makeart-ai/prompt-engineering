    It was on a cold winter's day that Anton first decided he wanted to be a writer. He was out for a walk, bundled up in a heavy coat and scarf, when he saw a sign in a bookstore window advertising a writing contest. The prize was a sizable amount of money, and Anton was immediately intrigued.

    He had always enjoyed writing, and had even dabbled in it a bit in his spare time, but he had never seriously considered it as a career. Now, however, the idea of being a professional writer suddenly seemed very appealing. He decided then and there that he was going to enter the contest and try to win it.

    The contest was not an easy one, and Anton worked hard on his entry for weeks. When the deadline arrived, he submitted his story and crossed his fingers. A few weeks later, he was thrilled to receive a letter informing him that he had won the contest!

    From that day forward, Anton dedicated himself to writing. He worked hard to hone his craft and soon became a successful author. He always remembered the cold winter's day when he first decided to pursue his ambition and was grateful that he had followed his dreams.

    It was a long walk home from the cemetery. Much longer than usual, because Nadia had to take a detour around the park. It was the first time she had been there since the incident. It made her feel uneasy, but she told herself she was being ridiculous. After all, it wasn't as if the park was haunted.

    Nadia tried to take her mind off of things by thinking about the funeral she had just attended. It had been a beautiful service, despite the sadness of the occasion. Nadia's friend, Maria, had been laid to rest next to her husband. It was only fitting, Nadia thought, since they had been so close.

    As Nadia walked, she couldn't help but notice how silent the park was. There were no birds singing, no children playing. It was as if the park was holding its breath. Nadia quickened her pace, eager to get out of the park and back to the safety of her own home.

    Suddenly, Nadia heard a noise behind her. She turned around, but there was nothing there. She must beimagining things, she thought. But then she heard it again. It sounded like footsteps. Nadia started to run, but it

    As I got closer, I could see that she was quite a bit younger than me. She looked to be in her early twenties, and she was very thin. She was wearing a pair of denim shorts and a tank top, and she had a backpack at her feet. Her hair was dyed a bright red, and she had a small nose piercing.

    She didn't say anything as I walked up to her, but she gave me a small smile. I could see that she was tired, and I wondered how long she had been standing there.

    "Do you need a ride?" I asked.

    She nodded, and I could see the relief in her eyes.

    It was a rare thing for him to take a walk during the daytime. He was usually either working or sleeping, and the few moments in between were mostly spent in a haze, numb to the world around him. But today he felt the need to move, to feel the sun on his skin and the wind in his hair.

    He had no particular destination in mind, and so he wandered aimlessly, his mind blank and free. He didn't think about his job, or his bills, or his nagging mother. He just let himself be, and it was a liberating feeling.

    He had been walking for hours when he finally came to his senses and realized that he was miles from home, with no idea how he had gotten there. It didn't bother him, though. In fact, he felt a sense of peace and calm that he hadn't experienced in a long time.

    He continued on his way, not caring where he ended up. For the first time in a long time, he was truly happy.

He was born in the United States, but his parents were from different countries. His father was from England and his mother was from Scotland. He had always felt like he was caught between two cultures and never really belonging to either one.

    Cameron grew up feeling like an outsider in his own country. He was always the odd one out at school and never really fit in with any of the groups. He had always been fascinated by other cultures and had dreamed of living in other countries. After he finished school, he took a year off to travel and ended up living in England for a while. He loved it there and felt like he finally belonged somewhere.

    However, after a few years, he started to feel like an outsider again. He didn't quite fit in with the English culture and he started to miss his homeland. He decided to move back to the United States, but he still felt like he didn't belong there. He felt like he was living in two different worlds and he was never really sure where he belonged.

    I’d been meaning to go on the Scavi tour for years. It’s a tour of the Vatican Necropolis, the burial site for many of the popes and other important figures of the Catholic Church. I’d always been fascinated by the idea of visiting a place where so many influential people had been laid to rest.

    Finally, last year, I got my chance. I was in Rome on vacation and I made sure to sign up for the tour as soon as I arrived.

    I have to say, it was everything I’d hoped for and more. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and passionate about the history of the necropolis. He took us to all the most important tombs, including those of Pope John Paul II and Pope Innocent VIII.

    But the highlight of the tour for me was definitely the tomb of Pope St. Celestine V. Celestine was a fascinating figure in history, and his tomb is beautiful and mysterious. Our guide told us the story of Celestine’s life and how he eventually became a pope, and it was all very interesting.

    Cameron wasn't sure what had led him to take up rock climbing, but he supposed it had something to do with a need for adventure. Whatever the reason, he was glad he had taken it up. It was something that was completely new to him, and he loved the challenge it posed.

    Cameron had been rock climbing for a few months now, and he had quickly become quite good at it. He had even started leading climbs, which was something that he took a great deal of pride in. He was always very careful and calculated when he was climbing, and he had never had any accidents.

    Today, Cameron was leading a group of three other climbers up a difficult route. He was moving smoothly and effortlessly, and the others were following his lead without any trouble. They were all doing well, and Cameron was feeling confident.

    Suddenly, Cameron's foot slipped on a loose rock and he lost his grip. He panicked for a moment before he was able to regain his composure. He slowly inched his way back up to the spot where he had lost his grip and then continued on.

    The rest of the climb was uneventful, and soon they were all safely back on the ground. Cameron was relieved that he

    Cameron was in the kitchen, preparing dinner. It was something she enjoyed doing, even though she didn't get to do it as often as she would like. She was slicing vegetables when her phone rang.

    She sighed, put down the knife, and went to answer it.

    "Hello?"

    "Cameron, it's me."

    She didn't need to ask who it was. She knew his voice too well.

    "Hey, Alex."

    "Listen, I need to talk to you."

    "What is it?" she asked, already feeling a sense of dread.

    "It's about us," he said. "I think we need to talk."

    She leaned against the counter, her heart sinking.

    "I think you're right," she said quietly.

    "Can I come over?"

    "Sure."

    She gave him her address and then hung up the phone.

    She stood there for a moment, staring at the phone in her hand.

    This was it. She knew it was coming, but she had been hoping against hope that it wouldn't.

    She went back to the kitchen and finished preparing dinner. She

    Cameron watched as the woman walked away from him, her hips swinging in an alluring rhythm. It was moments like these that made him question his commitment to his wife. He had been married for eight years, and in that time he had strayed from their marital bed on more than one occasion. Each time he told himself that it would be the last time, but he always found himself drawn back to the forbidden fruit.

    He knew that he loved his wife, but there was something about the thrill of the chase that was irresistible. He loved the way his heart would race as he tried to woo a new conquest, the feeling of excitement that came with each new conquest. It was an addiction, one that he knew he would never be able to give up.

    Tonight, he had been out with some friends, celebrating a colleague's promotion. They had been drinking heavily, and when the group had dispersed, he had found himself alone with one of the women from work. She was married, like him, but that didn't stop them from flirting with each other. One thing had led to another, and before he knew it, they were in a hotel room, naked and exploring each other's bodies.

    Cameron was at the park, watching the children play. It was a beautiful day, and the sun was shining. The birds were singing. The flowers were in bloom. Cameron felt at peace.

    Suddenly, Cameron's phone rang. It was his wife. She was crying.

    "What's wrong?" Cameron asked.

    "I found out that you've been cheating on me," she sobbed.

    Cameron's heart sank. He had been caught.

    "I'm so sorry," he said. "It will never happen again."

    Cameron hung up the phone and sat down on the bench. He felt terrible. He had betrayed the woman he loved. He had been unfaithful.

    Cameron knew that he had to make things right. He had to tell his wife the truth and ask for forgiveness. He had to do whatever it took to save his marriage.

    The next day, Cameron went home and told his wife everything. He apologized for his wrongs and promised to make things right. They hugged and cried and forgave each other.

    Cameron's marriage was saved, and he learned a valuable lesson. He learned that fidelity is the most important thing in a

    Cameron loved to laugh. It was one of his favorite things to do. He would laugh at the simplest things and it would just make his day. Cameron's laughter was so contagious that everyone around him would start laughing too.

    One day, Cameron was walking down the street and he saw a dog that looked really funny. He started laughing really hard and he just couldn't stop. People started to stare at him and some even started laughing too. Cameron just laughed and laughed until he was out of breath.

    "C'mon, you can do it!" Cameron's friends were urging him on, but he was shaking his head vigorously. "No way, I'm not going near that thing," he said, backing away.

    They were at the fairground, and the activity in question was the bungee jump. Cameron had always been a bit of a scaredy-cat, and his friends knew it. That's why they had been trying to get him to do the jump for the last half an hour.

    "Come on, it'll be fun," they said. "You only live once, you might as well do it."

    But Cameron was having none of it. He was content to watch from the sidelines as his friends took their turns at jumping.

    Then, suddenly, something changed. Cameron's expression went from one of fear to one of excitement. "You know what?" he said. "I'm going to do it."

    His friends cheered as he walked over to the bungee jump platform. Cameron nervously put on the harness, and then he was jumping.

    For a few seconds, he was weightless, and then the bungee cord started to pull him back up. He bounced a few

    Cameron had always been a bit of a jokester. It was one of the things that made him so popular with his friends. But there was one particular incident that they would always remember.

    It was during one of their usual get-togethers, when someone suggested playing a game of truth or dare. Cameron, being the daredevil that he was, immediately chose dare.

    The person who was supposed to dare him came up with something quite innocent. "I dare you to laugh for one minute without stopping."

    Cameron thought this was going to be easy. After all, he was always laughing. But the minute started, and he couldn't stop. The laughter just kept coming out, even though he tried to control it.

    The others were starting to get worried, as they had never seen him like this before. But Cameron just couldn't help it. The laughter was uncontrollable.

    Eventually, after what felt like a lifetime, the minute was up and Cameron could finally stop laughing. But the damage was done. His friends would never forget that day, and Cameron would always be known as the person who couldn't control his laughter.

The only light came from a small window high up in the wall. Cameron didn't move. He had been sitting there for hours, and he knew that he wouldn't be able to move until it was over.

    "And are you married?"

    "No."

    "Do you have a boyfriend?"

    "No."

    The man's eyes were blazing. "Then you're a cold, heartless corporate lawyer who is aiding and abetting criminal activities by the rich and powerful, and you don't even have a boyfriend. Is that right?"

    "No!" Cameron said. "I just want to make things right!"

    "Is that so? Then let me ask you this: does your work make the world a better place? Do the rich, powerful companies you represent actually do any good for society?"

    Cameron sat back in her chair. She hesitated before answering. "I suppose not," she said.

    "But you still don't have a boyfriend," he said. "Instead, you're fully committed to your ambition, which has led you to betray anyone of good faith. Tell me, does that make you happy?"

    "Happy?" Cameron was incredulous. "What kind of world would it be if I were happy? My job is tough! I don't get much sleep! I'm surrounded by enemies at all times!"

    The man leaned forward and pressed a button on the tape recorder.

    "Five minutes into this interview and I can't tell if you're ambitious or just tired," he said. "I think you need to take some time to think about what you're doing and whom you've become. There may be no way to save your soul. But I think, at the very least, you need to get some sleep."

    Cameron stood up. "What are you, a psychiatrist?"

    "Something like that," he said.

    "So you feel good about what your job," he said. "It doesn't bother you that your life is a waste?"

    "I never said that my life was a waste," she said. "I said it was fun to manipulate laws that are. Besides, I get to keep it out of the public eye. Thanks to me and the tax loopholes I find, the banks don't make it obvious they're stealing money. See, the US subprime loan crisis didn't happen because the loans were too much for Americans to repay. It happened because the banks kept buying bad mortgages, repackaging them, and selling them as if they were safe investments."

    "Okay," the man scoffed. A hint of a smile crept up his face. "You're aware that this is being taped, right? There's a camera filming this interview. And you're also aware that your name and face will be written into the script in whatever language we broadcast this documentary in."

    Cameron stared at him. Her brain had stopped working. The man stood up. "Thank you very much for your time," he said. He left the room.

    Cameron had no idea what just happened. She shook her head, and the tape recorder on the table stared right back at her.

    "I'm a corporate lawyer. I represent companies."

    "And what kind of companies do you represent?"

    "I represent all sorts of companies. But mostly I represent banks."

    "So you're a bank lawyer."

    "Yes."

    "And you help banks do what?"

    "I help them with all sorts of legal matters. I help them hide the fact that they've been stealing money from the government."

    Cameron put her hand on the man's arm and asked him, "Are you an aging jazz singer?" The man replied, "Why, yes! I sing both rhythm and blues, too." She continued by asking, "And, have you just had your third heart attack?" He answered, "Yes, and also my second stroke."

    Cameron got down on one knee and with a soft voice said, "Will you please marry me?" He replied with tears filling his eyes, "Of course, of course."

    Cameron had always wondered what it would be like to be married. Now, she knew. Yet there was something missing. What was it? Oh, yes, love.

    Two chairs were placed in the center of the room, and a tape recorder sat on a table to the side. A man and a woman sat in the chairs facing each other. The woman, Cameron, was dressed in a business suit. The man was wearing a leather jacket and jeans. He had a tattoo of a snake on his arm.
    Cameron shifted in her seat, uncomfortable under the man's gaze. She was not used to being in the spotlight. She was used to being the one in control, the one who asked the questions. But now she was the one being interrogated. And she didn't like it one bit.
    The man leaned forward, his elbows on his knees. "So, Cameron, what do you do?"
    "I'm a lawyer," she said.
    "And what kind of law do you practice?"
    "I'm a corporate lawyer. I represent companies."
    "And what kind of companies do you represent?"

    "And you help banks do what?"
    "I help them with all sorts of legal matters. I help them hide the fact that they've been stealing money from the government."
    The man nodded and leaned back in his chair. Cameron was pleased with her answer, but continued squirming under the man's gaze.
    "So you feel good about what your job," he said. "It doesn't bother you that your life is a waste?"
    "I never said that my life was a waste," she said. "I said it was fun to manipulate laws that are. Besides, I get to keep it out of the public eye. Thanks to me and the tax loopholes I find, the banks don't make it obvious they're stealing money. See, the US subprime loan crisis didn't happen because the loans were too much for Americans to repay. It happened because the banks kept buying bad mortgages, repackaging them, and selling them as if they were safe investments."
    "Okay," the man scoffed. A hint of a smile crept up his face. "You're aware that this is being taped, right? There's a camera filming this interview. And you're also aware that your name and face will be written into the script in whatever language we broadcast this documentary in."

    "Fine," she said. "But people aren't going to care anyways."
    "So you think people don't care?"
    "I know they don't. I make sure they don't."
    "How do you do that?"
    "I put out misinformation. I manipulate the mainstream media into sending out false news reports blaming President Obama and the Democrats. And I spread rumors that there isn't a problem."
    "And what kinds of rumors have you spread?"
    "I've spread a lot of different rumors, but some of the most effective ones are nonsense. Like what did we do before subprime mortgages came about? Some people believe that lie."
    The man leaned forward, his elbows on his knees, his eyes narrowing.
    "It is true, however, that American household debt is rising," Cameron said. "So I blamed it on personal irresponsibility. A lot of Americans fell for that."
    "But still, I'm sure there were Americans who knew better. They must have known about the predatory lending that was taking place."
    "Those people were easy to discredit. I gave them names like Chicken Little and Chickenhawk, and fed the media stories about how they were crazy conspiracy theorists. The mainstream media loves telling stories like that. And they love telling lies."
    "So you lied."
    "Look," Cameron said, "when the truth is hard to hear and too much to bear, it's better to lie."
    "So you lied to deceive."
    "But I saved America!"
    "America isn't worth saving," the man scoffed, and leaned back in his chair again. "What's the point of saving a corrupt country?"
    "The Founding Fathers, they were just a bunch of dead white guys," she said. She sat up, her back straight. "America has changed, and it needs a new model. We need to restructure, from the ground up. We need to start with the money."
    "So you want to take over. And you're using money as a weapon."
    "It's the only way," Cameron said. "But politics and the media don't care about truth. So I use lies to get the job done."
    "Lies over truth," the man said. "That's the American way."
    "That's the corporate way," Cameron said. "And in America, corporations have power. And any good executive will tell you that power is everything."
    "And you have some power, so you're happy?"
    "No one ever said that I had power. My job is to get corporations power, and I do a good job."
    "Yeah, you do a good job selling out your country for a paycheck."
    "Selling out? Selling out? I'm doing what it takes to help my family and the country. I'm using my talents for the betterment of all. Who are you to judge me? What are your talents?"
    "I'm a writer. And I'm here to write your story."
    "That's not a talent, that's a pen," she laughed. She sat back in her seat and crossed her legs. "Pen and paper is nothing but ink. And that won't change anything. I'm an overt force because that's what's required."
    "What's required by who?" he asked.
    "Have you looked around? America is in decline. There are massive problems. The poor have nothing, and the rich have too much. The middle class is nowhere to be found. Not even in the media."
    "Yeah, nobody watches the news anymore," the man said. "And nobody reads your newspapers or your magazines. I've got better things to do. I've got better things to read. Good fiction, for example. Well, I think we're done here. You can stand up now."
    Cameron stood up, brushing off her hands. "I like your tie," she said. "It's red."
    "It's not just red," he said. "It's a revolution."
    "I see," she said. "But revolution can only delay decline. Revolution doesn't build."
    The man nodded, and the two shook hands. The man smiled, a wide grin, and shook Cameron's hand hard, squeezing tight. She glared at him and snatched her hand away. 
    "I'll make sure they delete the video of me talking to you," she said.
    "Goodbye, Cameron," the man said, as he sat down again. The tape recorder was turned off. Cameron nodded and left the room.

It happened because the banks kept buying bad mortgages, repackaging them, and selling them as if they were safe investments."
    The man leaned forward in his seat again, though not as aggressively as before. He seemed genuinely curious. "Your job is to help hide government corruption, but money is not necessarily corrupted. It can be used in either a corrupt or uncorrupt way. How would you classify your bank clients' use of money?"
    "I suppose," she said, "that's what makes my job so satisfying. My job is not to judge other people's choices, but to help them acheive those choices. And while some of those choices may not be 'right,' you can generally see the person's point of view once you get to know them a little better."
    "So you wouldn't say that stealing from the government necessarily means inflicting harm on others."
    "No, I don't believe it does."
    A hint of a smile crept up his face. "You're aware that this is being taped, right? There's a camera filming this interview. And you're also aware that your name and face will be written into the script in whatever language we broadcast this documentary in."

    Two chairs were placed in the center of the room, and a tape recorder sat on a table to the side. A man and a woman sat in the chairs facing each other. The woman, Cameron, was dressed in a business suit. The man was wearing a leather jacket and jeans. He had a tattoo of a snake on his arm.
    Cameron shifted in her seat, uncomfortable under the man's gaze. She was not used to being in the spotlight. She was used to being the one in control, the one who asked the questions. But now she was the one being interrogated. And she didn't like it one bit.
    The man leaned forward, his elbows on his knees. "So, Cameron, what do you do?"
    "I'm a lawyer," she said.
    "And what kind of law do you practice?"
    "I'm a corporate lawyer. I represent companies."
    "And what kind of companies do you represent?"
    "I represent all sorts of companies. But mostly I represent banks."
    "So you're a bank lawyer."
    "Yes."
    "And you help banks do what?"
    "I help them with all sorts of legal matters. I help them hide the fact that they've been stealing money from the government."
    The man nodded and leaned back in his chair. Cameron was pleased with her answer, but continued squirming under the man's gaze.
    "So you feel good about what your job," he said. "It doesn't bother you that your life is a waste?"
    "I never said that my life was a waste," she said. "I said it was fun to manipulate laws that are. Besides, I get to keep it out of the public eye. Thanks to me and the tax loopholes I find, the banks don't make it obvious they're stealing money. See, the US subprime loan crisis didn't happen because the loans were too much for Americans to repay. It happened because the banks kept buying bad mortgages, repackaging them, and selling them as if they were safe investments."
    "Okay," the man scoffed. A hint of a smile crept up his face. "You're aware that this is being taped, right? There's a camera filming this interview. And you're also aware that your name and face will be written into the script in whatever language we broadcast this documentary in."
    "Yes," she said.
    "But that doesn't bother you?"
    "Not at all."
    They sat for a moment in silence.
    "Now that we've covered what you do," he said, "maybe we can get into why you do it.

    One rainy night in early October, I watched a documentary on Netflix. The documentary's subject was the subprime loan crisis and how it tanked the U.S. economy. A woman being interviewed for the documentary openly talked about her entire career being built around helping banks and corporations make tons of money. She also openly talked about how this was all legal, thanks to loopholes in the laws she discovered.
    When I watched this documentary, I had a message open with my landlord. We were discussing the water damage along the edge of the ceiling in my apartment. From the few times I had spoken with my landlord, I knew she was a very religious woman, a Christian.
    So my first response to the documentary was to tell her that she should pay me to fix the water damage and other issues with my apartment--extra-charge me, you know, giving me back some of my hard-earned money that I had paid her--because her greed represented the same greed portrayed in the documentary. I really didn't expect her to do it, but I thought it was a good way to demonstrate the absurdity of this situation.
    And that's how I came up with the idea for Corporate Hell. The evil I wrote about in my novel was inspired by a conversation with my landlord and a documentary on subprime loans.

    They sat for a moment in silence.
    "Now that we've covered what you do," he said, "maybe we can get into why you do it. "What makes you want to help big banks steal money from the government?"
    "It's not just big banks," she said. "I also help big corporations like Google, Pepsi, and General Electric avoid taxes."
    "Does that make you feel good, knowing you're helping move billions of dollars from the poor, middle class, and school district taxes to rich corporations?"
    "It doesn't matter if I feel good or bad. I just do it because I like the challenge of finding loopholes, and I like the feeling of being in control."
    The man shook his head. He wiped sweat off his forehead with his forearm. He leaned forward again. "Do you like the feeling of being able to pay lower taxes than 99% of the people in America?"
    "Of course," she said. "But it's not as if I'm doing anything objectively immoral. The government sets tax rates and laws. It just so happens that my job is to help certain corporations find loopholes in them. It's a game, and I especially love how the poor little people like you think I'm doing something immoral."
    "Not all of the little people think that," he said. "Even Jacob Lew, the United States Secretary of the Treasury, says he wants to close tax loopholes. It's not obvious that you're doing anything immoral. But it's not really obvious that what you're doing is moral either."
    "What's obvious is that my job is important. Without lawyers like me, big corporations wouldn't be able to make money in this country. If Congress was wise, it would make sure I had a job for life. It would take extra precautions to make sure that what I was doing wasn't illegal. It would make sure the laws allowed corporations to completely avoid paying taxes."
    "It's obvious that your job is important to the corporations," he said. "Not to the people who have to pay higher taxes because of loopholes you find. If corporations want to make money in the US, why not pay their fair share? Why not let the firms that make less than one billion dollars per year pass some their profits on to the poor, middle class, and schools?"
    "My job is about freedom," she said. "My job is about giving corporations the right to do whatever they want as long as they're fair. My job is about making sure corporations aren't forced to pay more than they believe is their fair share."
    "Your job is about making sure corporations are free to do anything they want," he scoffed.
    "Why shouldn't they be free to do anything they want?" she said.
    "Because they're not human beings," he said.
    "Of course they're not," she said.
