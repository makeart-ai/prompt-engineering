    There, in the upper corner, in small letters, was the name and telephone number of the lawyer.
    I must have looked at the number for a long time before dialing.
    I dialed the number, and a mature female voice answered, in Russian: "Yes? Is this about cocaine?"
    "No, no. It's about justice, about the truth."

    He finished sending the e-mail and looked up at the clock.
    It's time to leave, he thought.
    The very moment he thought that, the phone rang.
    He sighed.
    "Hello?"
    "Hello, could I speak to Mr. X?"
    "This is him."
    "This is from _____'s shopping mall.
    We have great news for you!
    You've just won one million yen.
    We'd like to congratulate you, but you're actually on a video conference call with all the staff of _____'s shopping mall."
    Mr. X let out a short breath.
    Ah, so it's one of those.
    So you don't really want to call yourself a scam after all.
    "I refuse your proposal."
    A long silence took over the phone.
    "Why?"
    "I said, I refuse your proposal.
    I won't fall for it.
    "
    He hung up.
    The very moment he hung up, the phone rang again.
    "Hello?"
    "Hello, could I speak to Mr. X?"
    "This is him."
    "This is from _____'s shopping mall.

    "I refuse your proposal."
    Another long silence took over the phone.
    "Why?"
    "I said, I refuse your proposal.
    I won't fall for it.
    "
    He hung up again.
    The very moment he hung up, he received a text message.
    "Eat shit and die!"
    Who would it be?
    Mr. X had no idea.
    Pressing the down button on the elevator, Mr. X suddenly became aware of the phone in his left hand.
    He was still holding the phone.
    He tilted his head.
    The elevator doors opened with a ding.
    When he looked up again, Mr. X saw a person in a suit standing right in front of him.
    "You!"
    The man spat at him.
    Mr. X stared at the small puddle of spit.
    The liquid slowly spread, like a spider's web, spanning across the shoes and up the pants.
    "Wait a moment," Mr. X said, smiling.
    "I must have forgotten to hit #."
    Mr. X turned to the elevator door.
    "That's not a phone."
    The man took a step back at those words, falling out of the elevator, green with fear.
    Just then, several hands reached out of the ceiling and covered the man's eyes, mouth, ears and nostrils.
    The elevator doors quietly closed.
    If you look closely, you will see a small symbol engraved on the left side of the door, but only if you look closely.

    I just got out of a really bad relationship.
    Yes, she was tall, didn't weigh much, and EVERYONE thought she had the perfect skin tone.
    She always smelt of fresh avacados in the morning.
    Her skin was soft as if it were made from kiwi seeds, and every time she laughed it sounded like someone stepping on a bag of subtle potato chips.
    She was the girl of my dreams.
    But one day, she got into a horrible face-lift accident.
    After that, our relationship took a turn for the worse.
    She wasn't expecting it either.
    She wanted to see other people, and since I didn't have a job, I wasn't able to keep her.
    Whenever I gaze longingly at her shriveled, gnarled face, I can't help but think of how much like the inside of a banana's skin it looks like.
    But then, I remember that she was never attracted to me.
    She says I always nose into her business, and leave my dirty underwear on the living room rug.
    If only my mother didn't throw all my Star Trek uniforms away -_-

    "You're such a cynic", said my mom, when I pointed that out.
    I told her, "The Bible says we should all be alarmed when we see six-six-six, so I've every reason to be worried!
    At that she chuckled and said, "you want to be safe from the devil if you act like this?
    That's what the devil wants!
    He doesn't want you to act silly every time you see," at this point she covered her mouth like little kids do sometimes and whispered, "the big bad number."
    After giving me a moment to see the humor I felt bad for laughing and remember that the Bible says God is the one who turns even our mourning into laughter, but nobody had died...

    "You're such a weirdo", I told my mom and she replied, "Honey, I just want you to enjoy family night.
    You and daddy are working too hard to be part of this and I worry that you aren't taking enough time to enjoy your time off because you're scared of making a mistake somewhere."

    What difference does it make what numbers come at the end of a phone number?
    Obviously the only reason I called was because I recognized the area code, but my mom was so worried about me calling the devil she never even considered that I might be ignorant of the area code too if I didn't recognize the number enough to call it!
    Could mom think I was that dumb?
    I'd better not mention that as I try to regain some sense of dignity.
    Why did she call me anyway?
    Did she want me to feel bad for not being able to celebrate Father's Day like she thought I should?
    But what?
    Couldn't she have just let family night go and called tomorrow?

    "We weren't doing anything special," I told her.
    What was she going to do if I really had been doing something or if I was occupied later tonight when she wanted to call sin?
    Was she hoping I could take care of her guilt like she always hoped daddy or me would take care of it?
    First of all, I can't make up for missing Father's Day by spending $5 on fast food just because she thinks it will make her feel guilty that I didn't get gifts form my kid brothers too?
    I'll tell her, "you want me to be more upset that I didn't celebrate with you than my kids were impossible for me to get them to sweep the floor?"
    Now it sounded like she was trying to make me feel bad for my kids too!
    That's it!
    She is going to give me a guilt trip in order to pass her guilt from her missing out on family night, whatever family night was supposed to mean!

    "I didn't say you were wrong about the area code," I bitched.

    "Or are you just using me because I'm a good way to absorb your crease cakes while you study?"
    I thought about the question a little, and then replied, "I think we should break up."
    She then got on her knees and said, "So be it" and broke up with me.

    It was just bananas.

    One day she told me about she had been unfaithful in our relationship, and that she had been having very intimate rendezvous with a young Mr. Potato Head who was married to someone she knew - someone who was six feet tall and was in love with a small potato.

    They had spent some very intimate moments together and she couldn't believe she had slipped up.
    MS. Potato head didn't have a job, but loved to be beside her pool.
    I pleaded her to stay.
    I told her that we could be happy together and that the potato was just a fling.
    She said before killing the potato she would first have to set him on fire while under water.

    She said that only if he could survive would she deny forgiveness.

    The potato had short arms, poor eyesight, and rode his bike every day.
    He wanted to be a doctor, or a lawyer, or even a make-up artist.
    His hobby was swimming, and besides for the awkward moments he had shared with MS. Potatoe Head, he had lived a normal life.

    His wife was six feet tall, (most potatoes are in fact very short.
    I think it has something to do with their diet).
    She fell into a deep depression and ended up standing on the edge of a bridge.
    She then grabbed a small vine, slung it around her neck, and jumped into the river. Sadly as she jumped, it ended up slipping and landing on her neck - breaking her hyoid bone.

    Her daughter didn't like the story and ended up being a vegetarian. 

    The End.

    I laughed hard inside, partly because I learned that Erica was a slut, and partly because I had been having very intimate rendezvous with her own mother, who I also knew very well.
    I hit Erica in the face with my third arm, and asked her if she had ever had a cold potato chip.
    She was speechless.
    I told her to go put on some lipstick, for Christ's sake, then left for my condo.

    I never saw her again.
    I never saw her mother again.
    I'm still married to my mail box, but our relationship has been stagnant (though I must say, she has a really good backbone). But, it's time damn time to move on.

    I called the number, and there's a message. It was her voice.
    The voice that sung my favorite part of the gospel amicably.
    The voice that could recite the entire Lord's Prayer twice in the time a hamster could type the letter "A".
    It was the voice I miss.....

    She took a deep breath. There was a slight pause. Then, she finally said it:

    I walked up to him, threw a bag of Basmati rice at his feet, and said "Mr. Potato Head, you've been a bad boy, and I'm here to make you pay."
    I picked up a sound bowl that I found next to his yoga mat, and hit him over the head with it.
    He fell to the ground, blood pouring from his head.
    I picked up the phone to call 911.

    The phone number I dialled ended with six-six-six.
    Fucking devils.
    Then there was a beep, and an operator asked me if I wanted to leave a voicemail.
    I did not.

    The man with a bleeding head stood up, and looked me straight in the eye.
    He said "I poisoned your avocado."
    I was stunned, and asked him "What do you mean you poisoned my avocado?"
    I was confused, and then I realised how he did it.
    He put the poison in the little holes on the side of the avocado.
    I hadn't noticed, as I was so caught up in her beauty.
    I said to him "You poisoned my avocado, so I'm going to do the same to you."
    I took the bag of Basmati rice, and chucked it into his face.
    He was angry, but I felt no remorse.
    I walked around him, and noticed that he had a fresh bag of potatoes in his wheelbarrow.
    I grabbed a potato, and started to shove it into his face.
    I shoved my first potato into his right eye, and he screamed in pain.
    When he had finished screaming, I took another potato, and shoved it into his left eye.
    He stood there, blinded, covered in blood and Basmati rice, with a bag of potatoes shoved into his eye holes.
    I said to him "I hope you die."

    I left Mr. Potato Head in his front yard, and walked back to my car.
    I was driving along, and I felt something wet on my shoulder.
    I looked to my right, and noticed that my ex-girlfriend was sitting next to me.
    I asked her "What are you doing here?"
    She replied "We need to talk."
    I said "Okay, but I'm driving, so I can't talk to you."
    She turned on the radio, and started to sing along.
    I was confused, and I stopped the car.
    I turned to her, and said "I thought you said we needed to talk."
    She said "I did, but I changed my mind."
    I asked her "What do you mean you changed your mind?"
    She said "I realised that I love Mr. Potato Head more than I love you."
    I was shocked, and I said "But he's a potato."
    She said "I don't care, he's the only one I love."
    I was angry, and I said "You're not leaving my house until you tell me that you love me."
    She said "No, I'm leaving with Mr. Potato Head."
    I said "Fine, I never want to see you again."
    She left, and I drove home.

    I got back home, and I was greeted by my neighbour.
    He started to talk to me, but I had forgotten what his name was.
    I said to him "Hey, what's up?"
    He said "Nothing much. You okay?"
    I said "Yeah, it's just that I'm a little shaken up."
    He said "What happened?"
    I said "My ex-girlfriend was unfaithful to me, and now she's left me for a man who is a potato."
    He said "That's awful. I'm sorry to hear that."

    I just got out of a really bad relationship.
    Yes, she was tall, didn't weigh much, and EVERYONE thought she had the perfect skin tone.
    She always smelt of fresh avocados in the morning.
    Her skin was soft as if it were made from kiwi seeds, and every time she laughed it sounded like someone stepping on a bag of subtle potato chips.
    One day she told me about she had been unfaithful in our relationship, and that she had been having very intimate rendezvous with a young Mr. Potato Head who was married to someone she knew.

    I learned Mr. Potato Head's real name.

    He wore a white turban, and a blue bathrobe.
    He told me that he was the owner of the golden nose, and that he was the god of the wind and the water.
    As he spoke, I could see the whites of his eyes turning red, and his pupils turning yellow.
    It made me feel like I was lost in the woods.

    I am the great Mr. Potato Head, and I will be back to get you."
    He ran into his house, and came back out with an AK-47.
    He shot at me, but I was too fast for him.
    I dove into my car and sped off.

    I had a friend who lived in the woods near Mr. Potato Head's house.
    I went over there to tell him about what had recently happened.
    I told him that Mr. Potato Head had been cheating on my girlfriend with my girlfriend.
    He was shocked, and didn't know what to say.
    He said "If I could, I would help you, but I can't.
    I don't even have a car."
    I told him that I would have to kill Mr. Potato Head and get revenge.
    He asked me if I'd like some tea.
    I said "Sure."
    He asked me what kind of tea I wanted.
    I said "Earl Grey."
    He said "Hm.
    I don't have that kind of tea."
    I said "Alright.
    What kind of tea do you have?"
    He said "Chamomile."
    I said "Okay."

    I left my friend's house, and bought a really cool new pair of shoes.
    I drove back home, put on the shoes, and went to bed.
    I didn't know whether or not I would wake up the next morning.
    I was worried that Mr. Potato Head would come in my room and kill me.
    I was worried that he would steal my body and use it to get revenge on my girlfriend.

    I was worried that I would never get over what I had done.
    I was worried that I would never be happy again.

    I just got out of a really bad relationship.
    Yes, she was tall, didn't weigh much, and EVERYONE thought she had the perfect skin tone.
    She always smelt of fresh avocados in the morning.
    Her skin was soft as if it were made from kiwi seeds, and every time she laughed it sounded like someone stepping on a bag of subtle potato chips.
    One day she told me about she had been unfaithful in our relationship, and that she had been having very intimate rendezvous with a young Mr. Potato Head who was married to someone she knew.

    I learned Mr. Potato Head's real name.
    I drove over to his house in a dark black car.
    When I got there, he was in his front yard, doing his morning yoga.
    I walked up to him, threw a bag of Basmati rice at his feet, and said "Mr. Potato Head, you've been a bad boy, and I'm here to make you pay."
    I picked up a sound bowl that I found next to his yoga mat, and hit him over the head with it.
    He fell to the ground, blood pouring from his head.
    I picked up the phone to call 911.

    The phone number I dialled ended with six-six-six.
    Fucking devils.
    Then there was a beep, and an operator asked me if I wanted to leave a voicemail.
    I did not.

    He walked into his kitchen and got out some water.
    The water was from a stream that ran through his property.
    He had a filter in his sink that cleaned the water.
    It was a pretty good filter.
    He put the water on the stove, and put the teabag in a cup.
    He turned the stove on, and watched the water boil.
    Then he turned the stove off and put the cup on the counter.
    He got out some milk, and put some of it into the cup.
    He stirred it with a spoon, and then he took the spoon out of the cup.
    He put the milk back in the fridge, and put the spoon in the sink.
    He brought the tea to me.
    "Here you go." he said.
    I took the tea from him and drank it.
    "Thank you for giving me this tea." I said.

    He said "I've got this old computer in the basement, and it's got a bunch of cool games and programs on it."
    I said "Oh, cool."
    He said "Yeah.
    I've been playing this one game, and I think it's really cool.
    It's called 'Angry Birds'."
    I said "That sounds cool."
    He said "Yeah, it's really fun.
    You should try it out."
    I said "Okay."
    He went into the basement, and came back with a giant computer.
    The screen was about thirty inches long, and the computer was about half the size of a man.
    It was a beast.
    He put it on the floor, and plugged it in.
    Then he opened up a program called "Steam".
    Steam is a program that allows you to buy, download, and play video games.
    He went to a page that said "Angry Birds", and clicked on a button that said "Play".
    A screen came up and said "Would you like to play this game in 'Windowed Mode' or 'Fullscreen Mode'?"
    I said "Windowed Mode."
    The game started up, and there was a little pig on the screen.
    I shot a bird, and the pig died.
    I said "That's pretty cool."
    He said "Yeah.
    It's a pretty fun game."
    I said "It's fun, but it's not really a game."
    He said "Oh, really?"
    I said "Yeah.
    Real games are like 'Mass Effect' and 'Halo'."
    He said "I've never played those games."
    I said "You should.
    They're really cool."
    He said "Okay."
    I got up and went home.
    I had to get some rest.
    In the morning I would go back over to Mr. Potato Head's house and kill him.

    I just got out of a really bad relationship.
    Yes, she was tall, didn't weigh much, and EVERYONE thought she had the perfect skin tone.
    She always smelt of fresh avocados in the morning.
    Her skin was soft as if it were made from kiwi seeds, and every time she laughed it sounded like someone stepping on a bag of subtle potato chips.
    One day she told me about she had been unfaithful in our relationship, and that she had been having very intimate rendezvous with a young Mr. Potato Head who was married to someone she knew.

    I learned Mr. Potato Head's real name.
    I drove over to his house in a dark black car.
    When I got there, he was in his front yard, doing his morning yoga.
    I walked up to him, threw a bag of Basmati rice at his feet, and said "Mr. Potato Head, you've been a bad boy, and I'm here to make you pay."
    I picked up a sound bowl that I found next to his yoga mat, and hit him over the head with it.
    He fell to the ground, blood pouring from his head.
    I picked up the phone to call 911.

    The phone number I dialled ended with six-six-six.
    Fucking devils.
    Then there was a beep, and an operator asked me if I wanted to leave a voicemail.
    I did not.

    In the meantime the man stood up, wiped the blood from his face, and said "Did you really think that would kill me?
    I am the great Mr. Potato Head, and I will be back to get you."
    He ran into his house, and came back out with an AK-47.
    He shot at me, but I was too fast for him.
    I dove into my car and sped off.

    I had a friend who lived in the woods near Mr. Potato Head's house.
    I went over there to tell him about what had recently happened.
    I told him that my girlfriend had been cheating on me with Mr. Potato Head.
    He was shocked, and didn't know what to say.
    He said "If I could, I would help you, but I can't.
    I don't even have a car."
    I told him that I would have to kill Mr. Potato Head and get revenge.
    He asked me if I'd like some tea.
    I said "Sure."
    He asked me what kind of tea I wanted.
    I said "Earl Grey."
    He said "Hm.
    I don't have that kind of tea."
    I said "Alright.
    What kind of tea do you have?"
    He said "Chamomile."
    I said "Okay."

    I said "Okay."
    He made me tea, and then he asked me if I wanted to go into the woods to look for berries.
    He made us both berry smoothies when we got back.
    They were delicious.

    Later that night, I went back to Mr. Potato Head's house and parked down the street.
    There was a man in a trench coat standing on the corner at the end of the block.
    I thought nothing of him.
    I walked up to Mr. Potato Head's house, and walked onto the porch.
    I knocked on the door.
    Mr. Potato Head answered the door.
    He looked at me, and said "You've come back to me."
    I said "Not exactly.
    I've come back to kill you."
    I drew out an Uzi, and shot him in the forehead.
    He fell to the ground, dead.
    I heard a police siren, so I ran back to my car.
    I drove off.
    I drove down the street and the man in the trench coat was still there.
    The police car was driving towards him.
    He pulled out a gun from his trench coat, and shot the police car.
    It exploded.
    He then turned around and shot at me.
    I floored it.
    He ran after me until he got tired and gave up.
    I drove away into the night, and that was the last day I ever saw Mr. Potato Head.

    I drove back to my friend's house to tell him about what had happened.
    He was worried that the police would find Mr. Potato Head's body.
    "The police will know that you did it," he said.
    I told him that I had already gotten rid of the body.
    I told him that I had taken the body to a dumpster behind a local deli.
    I don't know why I said that.
    It was a lie.
    I didn't get rid of the body.
    I left it in his front yard.
    I wasn't sure if the police would find it.
    I didn't know what would happen next.
    I hoped that nothing would happen.
    I hoped that we would just be left alone.
    We weren't.

    A few days later, my friend was found dead in his living room.
    He had been shot in the head.
    The police came to my house to ask me about what had happened.
    I told them that I didn't know anything.
    They didn't believe me, but they couldn't prove that I was lying.
    They left my house and told me to call them if I learned anything.
    I didn't.
    I sat down on my couch, and turned on the television.
    I ate some popcorn and watched a movie.
    I didn't know what else to do.

    A few months passed.
    My friend's murder was still unsolved.
    The police had stopped coming over to ask me questions.
    I was sitting on my couch and eating popcorn, as usual.
    I was watching a movie.
    Suddenly, I heard a loud bang at my front door.
    I opened the door, and it was the man in the trench coat.
    He shot me in the head.
    I fell to the ground, dead.
    This story wasn't meant to have a happy ending.
