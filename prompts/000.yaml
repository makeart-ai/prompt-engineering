    It''s been a pretty normal day here at the stupid blockycraft world. One of the
    villagers died because I shot him to find out if if the skeleton mob can kill
    villagers with ONLY that infinite blue potion of poisoning.

    Adios,

    Asshole'

  output: '"Hello" Jeff greeted the close family and friends huddled around his bedside.
    This had seemed like a miraculous occasion a few hours before. Now it just felt
    like everyone had gathered around for the last few grains to fall in the hourglass.
    He had already bid his adieus to those dearest to him.

    Now was not the time for sadness. Now was the time for last minute confessions.
    Jeff revealed the true story of stealing the hubcaps off old man Jones''s DeSoto
    in the seventh grade, tucked beneath the laundry hamper in his closet. He confessed
    his hidden desire to pursue a career in poetry that was reforged in the tinder
    of various part time retail jobs and ultimately snuffed out by a quiet but fatal
    recklessness. He confessed that his third grade teacher had always despised him.
    That he feared the deathgrip of lung cancer. That he felt both supreme happiness
    and utter despair in the moment when he held his baby boys nine fingers for the
    first time. He confessed that he could never quite shake the fantasy that he was
    raised by wolves and that it was this crippling insecurity that kept him from
    fully ludus into his dreams. To the final visitor he confessed that he would die
    a virgin.'
