    This is a famous story, Hills Like White Elephants by Ernest Hemingway. It starts like this.
  "output": |-
    The hills across the valley of the Ebro were long and white. On this side there was no shade and no trees and the station was between two lines of rails in the sun. Close against the side of the station there was the warm shadow of the building and a curtain, made of strings of bamboo beads, hung across the open door into the bar, to keep out flies. The American and the girl with him sat at a table in the shade, outside the building. It was very hot and the express from Barcelona would come in forty minutes. It stopped at this junction for two minutes and went on to Madrid.

    "You've got to do it," he said, his voice low and forceful. "You can't keep the baby."

    The woman shook her head, her eyes filling with tears. "I can't," she whispered. "I just can't."

    "Yes, you can," the man said. He came over and knelt down in front of her, taking her hands in his. "It's the only way. You know it is."

    The man across from her was her husband, and she loved him. But she could see the anger and frustration in his eyes. He was fed up with her, and she knew it.

    "We've been over this," he said, his voice quiet but firm. "You're going to have to get rid of it."

    "I know," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

    "I'm sorry, but you've left me no choice. Either you get rid of the baby, or I will."

    The woman looked up at him, her eyes filled with tears. "Please," she begged. "Don't make me do this."

    But the man was adamant. "I'm sorry," he said. "But it's either the baby or me. You have to choose."

    The woman looked down at her hands, her mind racing. She knew she loved her husband. But she also knew she couldn't have an abortion. She just couldn't.

He was dressed in a black suit and a white shirt, and he wore a black hat pulled low over his forehead. He hesitated for a moment, then walked over to the couple.

    "Excuse me," he said in a deep, resonant voice, "but I couldn't help overhearing your conversation. You mentioned that you were looking for something to drink. Might I suggest that you try the local wine? It's very good."

    The woman nodded. "I am so tired," she said. "I can't wait to get to the hotel and take a bath."

To the north, the view was shut in by a wall of blue-black rock, but to the south and west the land stretched away in gentle undulations to where the horizon melted into the haze of summer.

    The small train station was almost hidden among the trees that surrounded it. A few steps led up to the main door, and beside this was a wooden table and two chairs, which were placed so that anyone sitting there could enjoy the view. On the table stood a half-empty bottle of wine and two glasses.

    It was a warm day, and the couple sitting at the table were in no hurry to leave. They had an hour to wait for the train, and they were content to sit in the shade and enjoy each other's company.

    Although it was already past noon, the sun still blazed down mercilessly from a cloudless sky. A tiny village lay huddled at the base of a hill, and in the distance could be seen the long, winding ribbon of the railway track, disappearing finally into a tunnel. Between the village and the railway was a small inn, and outside the inn a young man and woman were sitting at a table, taking advantage of the scanty shade afforded by a couple of stunted trees. They had come out here to get away from the heat of the day, and also to have a few minutes to themselves, for they were very much in love.

    The girl was dark and slender, with large, expressive eyes and a passionate mouth. She was very young, not more than eighteen, and her beauty was of the exotic, southern type. The man was some years older, and his face, though not unhandsome, bore the marks of dissipation and hard living. He was not looking at his companion now, but was gazing absently out over the sun-baked landscape, his eyes half-closed against the glare.

    The girl was watching him closely, and presently she leaned over and laid her hand on his.

    The woman was fair-haired and blue-eyed, and she was wearing a white dress. The man was dark-haired and olive-skinned, and he was wearing a dark blue suit. They were both speaking in French, as the woman did not speak Spanish.

    "It's so hot today," the woman said. "I wish we had something to drink."

    "Don't worry, my love," the man said. "I will order us something." He called the waiter over and ordered two glasses of lemonade.

    The couple sipped their drinks and watched the people passing by. The woman asked the man about the different types of people she saw, and he told her about the different nationalities represented in the small town. He pointed out the Spanish, the Catalans, the Germans, and the British.

    It was a hot summer day, and the two people who were sitting outside the bar, a man and a woman, were also feeling the heat. The woman was Spanish, and the man was a foreigner. They had arrived at the station an hour before the train was due, and they had nothing to do but wait.

    The woman was not very talkative, but the man was. He talked about the heat, and about what a relief it would be when they got on the train and started to move. He talked about the beer he was going to drink on the journey, and about how much he would enjoy it.

    Suddenly, the woman said something in Spanish. The man did not understand what she said, but he could see from the expression on her face that she was asking a question.

    "What did you say?" he asked.

    "It's so hot today," the woman said. "I can't believe it's only June."

The man told the woman about his work and how he had to fix a broken pipe. They were both happy to be sitting in the shade, out of the sun.

    After a while, the woman said she was going to the restroom. The man said he would wait for her outside. The woman went into the bar and the man sat down on the bench in the shade. He took out his cigarettes and lit one. He was enjoying the quiet and the beer.

    The couple sitting outside the bar was grateful for the opportunity to drink something cold. They were both sweating heavily, and the woman was fanning herself with her hand.

    "It's so hot today," the woman said. "I can't believe how hot it is."

    "I know," the man said. "It's unbearable. I can't wait to get on the train and get out of this heat."

    "What should we drink?" the woman asked.

    "Beer, I think," the man said. "Beer is always good in this weather."

    The man went into the bar and ordered two beers. He brought them back to the table and the couple drank them quickly. The beer was refreshing and cooled them off a bit. They only had a few minutes left before the train arrived, so they ordered two more beers.

Inside, the bar was cool and dark. The walls were tiled to the ceiling, and there was a machine for cooling drinks.
