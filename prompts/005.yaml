      The challenge is reproduce a short story. "The School" by Donald Barthelme
    "original": |-
      Well, we had all these children out planting trees, see, because we figured that… that was part of their education, to see how, you know, the root systems… and also the sense of responsibility, taking care of things, being individually responsible. You know what I mean. And the trees all died. They were orange trees. I don’t know why they died, they just died. Something wrong with the soil possibly or maybe the stuff we got from the nursery wasn’t the best. We complained about it. So we’ve got thirty kids there, each kid had his or her own little tree to plant and we’ve got these thirty dead trees. All these kids looking at these little brown sticks, it was depressing.
      It wouldn’t have been so bad except that just a couple of weeks before the thing with the trees, the snakes all died. But I think that the snakes — well, the reason that the snakes kicked off was that… you remember, the boiler was shut off for four days because of the strike, and that was explicable. It was something you could explain to the kids because of the strike. I mean, none of their parents would let them cross the picket line and they knew there was a strike going on and what it meant. So when things got started up again and we found the snakes they weren’t too disturbed.
      With the herb gardens it was probably a case of overwatering, and at least now they know not to overwater. The children were very conscientious with the herb gardens and some of them probably… you know, slipped them a little extra water when we weren’t looking. Or maybe… well, I don’t like to think about sabotage, although it did occur to us. I mean, it was something that crossed our minds. We were thinking that way probably because before that the gerbils had died, and the white mice had died, and the salamander… well, now they know not to carry them around in plastic bags.
      Of course we __expected __the tropical fish to die, that was no surprise. Those numbers, you look at them crooked and they’re belly-up on the surface. But the lesson plan called for a tropical fish input at that point, there was nothing we could do, it happens every year, you just have to hurry past it.

      We weren’t even supposed to have a puppy.
      We weren’t even supposed to have one, it was just a puppy the Murdoch girl found under a Gristede’s truck one day and she was afraid the truck would run over it when the driver had finished making his delivery, so she stuck it in her knapsack and brought it to the school with her. So we had this puppy. As soon as I saw the puppy I thought, Oh Christ, I bet it will live for about two weeks and then… And that’s what it did. It wasn’t supposed to be in the classroom at all, there’s some kind of regulation about it, but you can’t tell them they can’t have a puppy when the puppy is already there, right in front of them, running around on the floor and yap yap yapping. They named it Edgar — that is, they named it after me. They had a lot of fun running after it and yelling, “Here, Edgar! Nice Edgar!” Then they’d laugh like hell. They enjoyed the ambiguity. I enjoyed it myself. I don’t mind being kidded. They made a little house for it in the supply closet and all that. I don’t know what it died of. Distemper, I guess. It probably hadn’t had any shots. I got it out of there before the kids got to school. I checked the supply closet each morning, routinely, because I knew what was going to happen. I gave it to the custodian.
      And then there was this Korean orphan that the class adopted through the Help the Children program, all the kids brought in a quarter a month, that was the idea. It was an unfortunate thing, the kid’s name was Kim and maybe we adopted him too late or something. The cause of death was not stated in the letter we got, they suggested we adopt another child instead and sent us some interesting case histories, but we didn’t have the heart. The class took it pretty hard, they began (I think, nobody ever said anything to me directly) to feel that maybe there was something wrong with the school. But I don’t think there’s anything wrong with the school, particularly, I’ve seen better and I’ve seen worse. It was just a run of bad luck. We had an extraordinary number of parents passing away, for instance. There were I think two heart attacks and two suicides, one drowning, and four killed together in a car accident. One stroke. And we had the usual heavy mortality rate among the grandparents, or maybe it was heavier this year, it seemed so. And finally the tragedy.
      The tragedy occurred when Matthew Wein and Tony Mavrogordo were playing over where they’re excavating for the new federal office building. There were all these big wooden beams stacked, you know, at the edge of the excavation. There’s a court case coming out of that, the parents are claiming that the beams were poorly stacked. I don’t know what’s true and what’s not. It’s been a strange year.
      I forgot to mention Billy Brandt’s father who was knifed fatally when he grappled with a masked intruder in his home.
      One day, we had a discussion in class. They asked me, where did they go? The trees, the salamander, the tropical fish, Edgar, the poppas and mommas, Matthew and Tony, where did they go? And I said, I don’t know, I don’t know. And they said, who knows? and I said, nobody knows. And they said, is death that which gives meaning to life? And I said no, life is that which gives meaning to life. Then they said, but isn’t death, considered as a fundamental datum, the means by which the taken-for-granted mundanity of the everyday may be transcended in the direction of —
      I said, yes, maybe.
      They said, we don’t like it.
      I said, that’s sound.
      They said, it’s a bloody shame!
      I said, it is.
      They said, will you make love now with Helen (our teaching assistant) so that we can see how it is done? We know you like Helen.
      I do like Helen but I said that I would not.
      We’ve heard so much about it, they said, but we’ve never seen it.
      I said I would be fired and that it was never, or almost never, done as a demonstration. Helen looked out of the window.
      They said, please, please make love with Helen, we require an assertion of value, we are frightened.
      I said that they shouldn’t be frightened (although I am often frightened) and that there was value everywhere. Helen came and embraced me. I kissed her a few times on the brow. We held each other. The children were excited. Then there was a knock on the door, I opened the door, and the new gerbil walked in. The children cheered wildly.

  "output": |-
    It was the end of another school year, and I was reflecting on what had transpired over the past nine months.

    I had started the year with high hopes. I was determined to instill a sense of responsibility in my students, and so I assigned them each a pet to take care of, or a plant to water, or a charity to raise money for.

    But one by one, the pets died, the plants withered, and the charities folded. And each time, my students would ask me the same question: "Does this mean that death is what gives life meaning?"

    I tried to explain to them that it is life that gives life meaning, but they just didn't seem to understand.

    Then, at the end of the year, one of my students asked me if I would make love with Helen, the teaching assistant. "We just want to see how it's done," she said.

    I declined, of course. But as I watched the new gerbil walk into the classroom, unclaimed and unneeded, I couldn't help but wonder if my students were right after all.

    I had been trying so hard to instill a sense of responsibility in my students, giving them responsibility for the well-being of pets, plants, and charitable causes. But one by one, these products of the students' attentions died or otherwise disappeared.

    The children would come to me and ask why death was such an important part of life. I would try to explain that it wasn't death that gave life meaning, but life that gave life meaning.

    But then they would ask me if I was going to make love with Helen, the teaching assistant, so they could see how it is done. And I would have to demur.

    So it was with a sense of relief that I greeted the new gerbil that walked into our classroom one day. The children were immediately drawn to it, and for once I didn't have to worry about their safety.

    "What about the pets?" she asked finally.

    "He died of leukemia," the teacher said quietly. "It was very hard on the kids."

    Still another silence fell over the room.

    "No, I don't think that's it," another said. "Maybe we're not giving them enough attention."

    "Maybe we're over watering them," a third student suggested.

    The teacher thought about it for a moment and then came up with a solution. " from now on, I will water the plants myself." he said. "And I will make sure that they get enough sunlight."

    ## Complete Story

    Pain consumed me.  It was not my head that ached like a lead ball or my
    fingers that had been on fire but now burned with a slow and steady heat.
    I had the sensation that my ribcage was being crushed down on my lungs,
    ribs bending over themselves trying to escape from my torso into the
    strangulating vacuum around me—the only indication that there was air.  I
    could not tell if my eyes were open or closed.  A bitter flavor lingered in
    my mouth, so sickly sweet that it seemed to transcend taste.  My mind
    thought I was crying, but the back of my eyes felt dry and scratchy.  My
    skin was cold, clammy, and still.

    I forced my eyes open (or was it already open?) and I fumbled for my
    eyeglasses on the nearby table and put them on.  I was soft in my chair, as
    if I had been lying there for some time, but my shirt wasn't that
    disheveled, and I'd dressed in pants instead of sweatpants.  I got myself
    out the chair and closed my mouth.  Thanks to my nephews' desperate
    requests for another five minutes of playtime before bed, I'd developed an
    excellent sense of time, even when I was…

    "South American Giant Tamandua."

    I turned around, then realized it was my voice.

    The room was in darkness, which was good; I had dimmed the lights before
    sitting down.  I turned on the lights and scanned the room.  A cage sat
    unremarkably on a table near the back of the room.  Against the wall near
    me a well-worn poster of the Giant Maned Tamandua was tacked to the white
    board.  I was sitting behind a long table wearing my usual black uniform,
    which was the outfit I had worn to work yesterday.  Jargon copied the
    fellow sitting at the lower right of the poster by 'crossing eyes' with me;
    he was lying at my feet on one side.  Mico and Maggy were in their hammock
    in the corner, but Mico had turned over to face me and was starting to
    rub his face even from where he lay with his eyes closed.

    I made sure I had enough control over my muscles to walk, then crossed the
    room wearily and sat down again.  Ignoring the objects in my peripheral
    vision, I directed all my attention toward the cage.  I was astonished to
    find a female Giant Anteater (Myrmecophaga) staring at a corner of the cage
    with her mouth open in what would be a yawn if she lacked the ant-primitive
    mandible.

    I checked the situation against the starting point of the loop.  Each time
    it was the same.  I was at work; I fell asleep; I woke up; everyone and
    everything was as I had left them.  There were always a few things that
    were different; such as, the poster I maintained on the whiteboard to keep
    myself from getting uninterested in the job, and the supplies that I
    frequently had to restock to keep my charges comfortable and interesting.
    In those few times I woke up finding my charges dead and there being no
    point in staying at my job, I tried to perform a mercy killing and
    dispose of my charges' bodies.  Somehow there would always be more
    replacements waiting for me in the office.

    A loud thump punctuated the negative space in my thoughts.  My newest
    charge was learning the room.  I enjoyed watching colony creatures like
    ants and ant-eating mammals getting used to new environments.  Sometimes
    I'd leave a handkerchief or a washcloth on the floor.  Here and there I'd
    take bites out of an apple and wash it down with tea.  Throughout the day
    I'd sit and watch a small wild animal forage for any apples I may have
    dropped or otherwise left behind.

    There was something different about this loop.  No, something
    unchanging.  One of my usual students, Amy, was no longer attending my
    class.  After she had been gone a couple of weeks, the other students
    seemed satisfied not to press me for answers about her.  It shouldn't have
    bothered me, for Amy was less and less of a student as time went on and
    more of a menace to herself, but still I was bothered.  Even when I knew
    how bad this whole cycle was going to end up, I couldn't escape the
    feeling of guilt.  I had been beginning to consider writing off Amy's
    absence as her parents' way of sending her to the best doctors they could
    afford, or worse, an abandonment on their part.  I knew just by looking at
    her that it would be wise to look elsewhere for an answer, if any answer
    were to be found, and that looking at her more would only make it worse.
    It was probably because of this that I paid less attention to the quiet
    little girl than the many distractions around me.

    Mico got off the hammock.  I watched him come closer.  These two
    brothers were in the second generation of Hamsters at the school each
    year.  The school's first generation of Hamsters were from the same strain
    of Dwarf Hamsters.  The next year a new strain was introduced.  The new
    strain's grandkids kept the Dwarf Hamster strain at bay, but a few of
    them still lived to mount a defense against the new strain's grandkids.
    Maggy crawled to the opening of the hammock and watched a Mico interact
    with me.

    # The story

    During the first week of classes, I gave each of my students a bean to take home. If the student was successful in tending the bean, we would eat it at the end of the year as a class.

    The first bean died when the student left it in the garage overnight on a very cold night. He had just meant to go out to the car to get something, but then forgotten. The bean froze. Of course, it might have been successful outdoors. But heck, if we have to have some arbitrary success like that, we might as well gamble on a pigeon race. Nobody won the pigeon races, either, and I never heard of anyone eating a pigeon, either.

    The second bean didn't die, but it didn't sprout, even after repeated soaking in mustard seed water. In the end, everyone had a look at the shriveled piece of vegetable matter and threw it away in the classroom garbage can.

    The third bean finally sprouted and then died a mysterious death. Upon investigation, I found the child had drowned it in a fit of emotion. The story goes that the parent and the chlid had a fight about picking up the bean to mist it, and after the fight the child dropped the plant and drowned it. Then said parent suggested disposing of the "evidence".

    The fourth bean no one knows what happened to it, but somehow it disappeared. Most likely, it was stolen by the cat in the middle of the night and disposed of noisily in the backyard. This story, the student at first denied, and the parent was completely astonished.

    The fifth bean didn't die. At the very least, it was stolen, but the story that the child told was a fantastical one. The child placed the bean on the floor of the house at 8:00 pm to watch it while she watched TV. The child also fell asleep while watching TV. When awoken by the parent at 9:00 pm, the child blamed the dog for stealing the bean. Upon inspection of the dog's feces, no evidence of the bean was found. There is no further information on the bean. This child disappoints me the most, because of successfully losing or throwing away the bean. And the story doesn't make any sense, either. He should have said the dragon stole it and flew away. Then we would have had something to work with.

    I also gave each student a pet fish as part of the class. The hypothesis was that if the students had these pets in the classroom, and then took them home, then the students would become more responsible for each other.

    Just one week after taking the fish home, the report about the first fish came. One of the students made it a science project and was trying to discover whether worms (his bait) could eat through their tank, and he left the worms in their tank. When I heard this, I went to the classroom and found the first fish had been eaten. Later, the parent complained that he didn't ask permission to cook the fish. The other fish also died.

    Next I had the class adopt a child through a Christian charity. Several of the children's parents objected that the child might die, but nonetheless the group decided to continue. They chose a name for the child and sent off their 25 cents each month for the child's necessities. And then after some months, the letter came back. The child had been struck with a fatal childhood disease. I sent the letter back to the adoptive parents. But I heard later that they immediately forgot that they had adopted a child. The child still died.

    And then tragedy hit the class. Another child sitting at the back of the room suddenly died. He had enjoyed perfect health up until that moment, according to the child's mother. The cause of death is unknown and still, to this day, remains mysterious.

    When asked about the child, the children's answers were quite evasive. And when I pressed, they answered they didn't know, but maybe he had died.

    The class, being a high level class, seemed to be very comfortable with the subject of mortality. They reached several understandings. One, we all have to die some day. Two, children require adult supervision. Three, not all adults are responsible.

    Taking the first point, some of the children told me about their experiences on the Internet. They had discovered after a lot of searching and browsing some websites very "shocking". One student said, finding a website contained a picture of someone dead. He said, dead people are not very pretty. It makes them question the meaning of life. Another student said that burial is obviously one way to go about disposing of dead bodies. There is a big business in this country. And perhaps, said the child, some people may end up in their back yard.

    Oh, that they were so lucky. I'm sure the authorities will just throw them in the ground.

    In addition to the second point, the children felt they could be very responsible. Many of them mentioned having to wash dishes or clean their own rooms. Some of them reported that they fed the dog.

    In addition to the third point, well, the children thought that adults were sometimes irresponsible. As many as one in three adults can be irresponsible.

    Another point of discussion was the meaning of death. People who do not believe in God think that when you die, you go away for good. They have very little fear of dying. And if you ask them about their fear of death, they say that they have picked the belief carefully.

    But I don't know about that. People fear death just because they fear it.

    One day, the children came to me and said that they had a question about sex. Specifically, they wanted to know what the birds and the bees did. And even more specifically, they wanted a demonstration of what human beings did.

    I told them that this was beyond the bounds of my classroom and professional responsibility, and besides, I didn't know the answer.

    Just then the classroom door opened, and a cat walked in. One of the children said, I know the answer. The cat couldn't have come in by itself -- it must have been brought in by a human. The cat's owner had been sending the cat to my classroom to destroy evidence of the previous pets' demise.

    So then I suggested that they ask the cat.

    And then one child asked the cat.

    The cat said, I don't know. I haven't done it yet. And then it sat down and licked its paw.

    I still don't know why this story ended. But the children have adopted the cat and the cat seems to be enjoying its new and privileged position as the pet of a class of children.

    # The full story
    The teacher related to the unseen audience the results of an entire semester's worth of exposure to death and decay.
    The first half a dozen pets were neglected, died, and were replaced.
    Then these replacements were neglected, died, and were replaced, until finally the teacher ran out of pets.
    The plants died of thirst and exposure.
    Responsibility for charitable causes was assumed without much conversation, so they too were neglected, and the teacher had no idea what outcome would result from these endeavors.
    After all this, the students came to the realization that what they gave to the world could not be appreciated by the world, so they began to wallow in self pity.
    Further thought led them to question what the outcome would be for themselves, for their parents, for the teacher, or for any person.
    After talking about the purpose of life and the reason for being, the children determined that there was only one person who could answer these questions well, and that person was their teacher.
    So they demanded an answer.
    The speaker described the evolution of these events, making several attempts at an answer, first with words, then with pictures, finally with the complete act of sex.
    Yet in spite of this effort, no answer was complete.
    As the teacher crossed the finish line, so to speak, a dog crawled out from the rafters onto the desk, where it started to urinate.

    # The story in full

    After the students have planted seeds for a variety of plants, watered them and selected their favorite plant each, the plants fail to sprout and die.
    A question arises from one student regarding the reason for the plants' death.
    The teacher gives the class an unsatisfying answer, but the student does not seem satisfied with that answer.
    However, the student gives up his doubt and ignores the event.
    After the event, some students bring pets from outside and take care of them.
    Those animals also die, and their owners bring the dead animals to class.
    Unexpectedly, one student finds his mother dead at home.
    After losing their relationship with animals, the class members gradually lose the connections among them and die one by one.
    As the members die, the student who brought his mother's dead body to the classroom discusses death and the meaning of life with the teacher.
    When the psychologist, who has always been with the teacher, is invited to the class, the student asks the teacher to demonstrate a sex act with the psychologist in front of the class so that the class memebers can satisfy their sexual desire.
    The teacher denies his student's request and tells the student that everyone in the class should learn the importance of sex themselves.
    However, when the student opens the door, a house cat appears in the classroom.
    The remaining students are excited about the end of the class and their encounter with the cat.

    # Summary
    1. I decided to start a window garden in the classroom. We started with twenty plants and the students each chose one to tend to. We watched them flourish and grew to love them. Then, suddenly, they all died. Each one except for one that was tended to by the brightest student of the class, who was, coincidentally, a friend of mine; at least, I thought so until I saw her throw her plant outside after it died and heard her laugh.
    2. In an effort to move on from the devestation caused by the loss of our plants, I decided to bring a puppy to the school to have as a co-student. We named her Beatrice. We all chose to sleep with her on the first night, but the next day when she wasn't in her cage, we asked each student where she was. One student said that he saw his friend throw Beatrice out the window. I demanded to know the student's name. He said it was Franklyn. For the next week, I refused to speak to Franklyn and his friend, my former friend. The next week, a student named Imogen told me that she heard a dog crying somewhere in the school after lunch. After some searching, we found Beatrice again. She was in bad shape, so we were confused. Someone suggested that as part of an initiation for the school's gang, one must kick the puppy down the stairs, and that this happens many times in the school. We loved Beatrice and weeding out the gang members was difficult, but we did our best. A month later, we received the nice puppy in a box. It read “Besto Regards, Franklyn.”
    3. The previous incident with the puppy made us all so fearful of the gang that we found a way to adopt an Indian child so that we could protect her and her mother from them. Immediately, we saw improvement in the school. The gang was so afraid of harming an adopted kid that they backed down. People became more friendly and actually talked. The roomies were never in better spirits. 

    One day, after after Pooh (the adopted kid) got back from eating lunch at the cafeteria some of the roomies began to gag and felt their feelings rise. Again, after Pooh got back from the bathroom, Lori, the roomie who was closest with Pooh started to feel a pain in her chest. After about five minutes, Lori hit the floor and started to gag and cough violently. Faster then we could comprehend, Lori started to convulse uncontrollably. In one last attempt, we called the nurse. The nurse simply looked up from her desk and said that everything was going to be fine. Finally, just as the last bit of blood left Lori's chest, she stopped shaking and everything became quit. We will forever be changed. 

    Shaken by what just happened we all individually went up to our teacher and asked her what just happened. She told us that God had taken the only roomie that mattered and that we were all going to die just like that. Right at that moment, one of the new roomies walked in and said 'Please don't let this be true. I just met them yesterday, but I don't want to die without knowing about anyone.?' The whole class became silent. In a melodramatic and vague manner, we all slowly got up, walked out of the classroom, and left each other to perish. The next day, only one day after all of us had swarmed out of the classroom, I asked my assistant is she had seen any of the others in the classroom since the mysterious death of Lori. 

    She told me that they cried ever since they left the classroom and have kept to their little hideouts. I decided to go out and look for my dearest friends and upon doing so, I found them all. They were all in their homes. Some dead and others simply on the brink of death. Every single one of them was simply sobbing over the loss of their friend. 
    4. In an attempt to inform the roomies, who were as shattered as I, that I was back and that I was still alive, I decided to ring the bell before class. I then waited and listened for anyone. As I sat there and listened, it occurred to me that Lori was not only dead, but she was also my best friend. In the quiet of my classroom, I thought of how torn Lori was from inside and how divided she had been from the very beginning. 

    I then realized that I had been the cause of Lori’s death and that she had taken so much hurt over the years because of me that she could not take it anymore and died out of hurt. I do not think that my roomies will ever understand the pain I experienced. Seeing Lori die right in front of my eyes, I felt like crying, but I couldn’t. My body was frozen. I did not feel pain. I did not feel cold. My mind was still but my body was paralyzed. I will forever be traumatized by the entire incident. 

    After learning that Lori was truly dead, I longed to find out how it really happened. I am certain that if someone had done it on purpose, it was most likely her evil roommate, Franklyn. Now, there is a large manhunt for Franklyn and I am sure that Franklyn is long gone by now. It is too late for Lori, but at least I can help others to avoid being crushed by the painfully heavy rock of pain and suffering. 
    5. Things are getting better now that Franklyn’s parents have died. May they rest in peace. 

    We decided that we should not immediately call the police after the murder of Franklyn’s parents because we felt that it would be disrespectful to the family. We wanted both them and Franklyn to have a proper burial. 

    Furthermore, we wanted to bring Franklyn to safety so that one day he could be retrieved from this living hell. We wanted everyone else to remain in mourning. Even though I know that no one knows about the murder, I am also certain that everyone else knows what is going on. Everyone else is worrying about each other, exchanging glances, and bowing their heads. Everyone else was worried about Franklyn and how he will survive alone. He was not alone, but instead he was with us. Each of us felt the pain of Franklyn and so we stepped out secure in his company. Right after the police arrived, we all went to our desks and prepared for class. We did not talk. We simply sat there, thinking about what happened. I was thinking that peace had come to us but we were still disturbed by the passing of Franklyn’s family. We sat in class, waiting for more tragedies to come and hoping that Franklyn would be saved. 
    6. If there was any truth to the story that Mr. Ronny told us about “the little boy who lived”, then I am sure that Lori’s soul had passed on to him and will only be living for a few more years. The roomies were talking about how it was possible that the little boy from Mr. Ronny’s story was Lori’s soul, who had passed on to the little boy. I doubted that he was, but I had to believe that our little girl would be around forever. I also wondered how long it would be before I found my own soulmate.

    # Full story

    As a teacher I can no longer take the pressure. I taught in this school for the past 34 years and it seems to me that I have run out of ideas on how to instill in my students a sense of responsibility and will
    to live.
    The reason for concern for the younger generation is not quite clear to me, because death does not seem to be either imminent or painful, at least for the
    souls that appear to be free.
    To end my days in a state of bliss, I decided to give this farewell speech to my pupils, in which I hope to acknowledge their common cause and possibly find some comfort in their embrace, when
    my heart will still beat and they will follow my last advice: let us be attached to one another.
    In retrospect, it seems that the tragedy started at the beginning of this
    school year, with the school plant named after the founder of our institution, the poet Wystan Auden.
    Despite all my efforts to water and fertilize it, the plant stubbornly refused to grow. Soon, it was discovered to be a plastic vine and the bewildered school
    administrators managed to exchange it for a real, although once already dead, aloe vera.
    After performing some Santeria rituals, the rootless aloe vera began a slow, but
    hopeful recovery, until a school fire burned the bush to the ground.
    Then came the pets. Our school has three rabbits and one guinea pig. A few weeks ago,
    it was decided that these unfortunate creatures would receive the children's attention and the money raised during the autumn fair.
    The initiative seemed successful until the rabbits died, apparently
    from inadequate attention. The death of the guinea pig was a shock even to the
    harshest critic of guinea pigs. More specifically, the animal was set on fire by
    the most intelligent member of the class, the six-year-old Teddy, who, in spite
    of his age and the overwhelming IQ, does not possess a full set of parental
    advisers and guardians.
    To our students' pleasant surprise, their flock was again replenished by the
    administration, this time with a more sociable dog named Attila. This canine
    acquisition was cause for celebration and it was decided, to our regret and
    especially that of Attila, that we would unite in pursuit of a common cause,
    namely saving a six-year-old African girl. The recipient of our charity was,
    somewhat predictably, named Silvia, and she lost both arms and legs when she was
    hit by a falling coconut tree.
    Unfortunately, a couple of weeks later, Silvia got sick and died of
    undetermined causes, while our slumbering Attila came home with 2 legs and a
    drooping tail.
    In a few weeks, it became increasingly clear that our students, who have recently
    paid for significant examination-related medical expenses, no longer have any
    opportunity to adopt a family member or a family member or to contribute
    to a classmate.
    The only new pupil, a sixth grader named Tristan, was brought to school one
    hopeful and quiet morning. Tristan, the last of his species, and the only
    disease-free third-grader in the world, was deceased within a few minutes. This
    particular student, who will remain anonymous, made the mistake of interrupting
    the impromptu eulogy, claiming that Tristan no longer just looks like a
    mannequin. The fatal mistake turned into a tragedy when Tristan was hit by a
    bullet that no one shoots and no one sees.
    I must confess that after these tragic events, I am really attached to the
    survivors of my class, especially to Teddy and his fainting dog. These special,
    if somewhat depressed, creatures have supported me from the beginning, but with
    this series of disasters, they grew closer and we were finally able to talk. I
    was able to understand Teddy better when I noticed that he's staring at me
    without blinking and that he's hiding Attila in a cage, strangling him every
    night.
    I also explained to them the reason why they are not allowed to visit us when they are
    very young, the complete silence that has descended on the neighbourhood, the
    fact that the other parents' children attend funerals every day and how their
    siblings were sent to my colleague upstairs to avoid any unpleasant contact.
    Because no one can afford to pay for the release of their own children anymore,
    especially for sex-related purposes, Teddy only wanted to see me and my assistant
    demonstrate the technical aspects of the sex act between men and women.
    Frankly, I do not object to this request, but with the absence of the other
    students, the closure of the school, and the inevitable closure of my
    establishment from a broader perspective, it does not seem to be worth the time
    and effort.
    I will confess to you, dear children, that I am now close
    to you and also to Attila, who is once again free and is not what he used to
    be.
    I am delighted to see that you are still together and will continue to be
    together after my departure, and I hope that this attachment will transcend my
    arrogance and stimulate you to build a better tomorrow.

I was able to understand Teddy better when I noticed that he's staring at me without blinking and that he's hiding Attila in a cage, strangling him every night.
    I also explained to them the reason why they are not allowed to visit us when they are very young, the complete silence that has descended on the neighbourhood, the fact that the other parents' children attend funerals every day and how their siblings were sent to my colleague upstairs to avoid any unpleasant contact.  Because no one can afford to pay for the release of their own children anymore, especially for sex-related purposes, Teddy only wanted to see me and my assistant demonstrate the technical aspects of the sex act between men and women.  Frankly, I do not object to this request, but with the absence of the other students, the closure of the school, and the inevitable closure of my establishment from a broader perspective, it does not seem to be worth the time and effort.
    I will confess to you, dear children, that I am now close to you and also to Attila, who is once again free and is not what he used to be.
    I am delighted to see that you are still together and will continue to be together after my departure, and I hope that this attachment will transcend my arrogance and stimulate you to build a better tomorrow.

    # Full story

    I was trying to teach the children something about responsibility.
    I brought a plant into the classroom, and told them how to care for it.
    It died.
    I told them it was their fault.
    I then brought in a dog, and showed them how to care for it.
    It died.
    I told them it was their fault.
    Then we adopted a child, and I showed them how to care for her.
    She died.
    I told them it was their fault.
    Then they started dying.
    First just a few of them, then most of them, then all of them.
    Then some of their parents started dying.
    We talked about the meaning of death and life.
    "It's like life is a swimming pool, and death is the deep end," said one of the children.
    "Why does nobody just stay in the shallow end?" said another.
    "Children, I have something to tell you," I said.
    "I'm going to show you something."
    I took my assistant, and we demonstrated sex to the children.
    A kitten appeared on the scene.
    "Let's care for it together," I said.

    # The Story

    ## 1. Plants die
    "I started the school year with the best of intentions.
    I wanted for my students to grow up with a sense of responsibility, so I started them with some responsibility for something other than themselves.
    I gave them plants to take care of.
    But then, my students let the plants die."

    ## 2. Pets die
    "I thought that perhaps I should have been more specific in my instructions.
    Not wanting to leave any room for error, I gave my students the responsibility of caring for pets.
    I was sure that they would be more careful with pets than with plants.
    But then, my students let the pets die."

    ## 3. Adopted child dies
    "I thought that perhaps I should have been even more specific in my instructions.
    I decided to put my students in charge of somebody they would really care about.
    I put my students in charge of an adopted child.
    But then, my students let the adopted child die."

    ## 4. Students of the class die
    "I thought about what I could do next.
    I decided that my students would take it the hardest if they were responsible for their own classmates.
    I put my students in charge of the other students in their class.
    But then, my students let the other students in their class die."

    ## 5. Some students' parents die
    "I didn't know what to do.
    My students were not taking responsibility for other people.
    It was time to bring the parents into the conversation.
    I put my students in charge of their own parents.
    But then, my students let the parents die."

    ## 6. Children and teacher talk about the meaning of life in the face of death
    "I sat down on the floor and cried.
    I put my head in my hands and wept.
    I didn't know what to do.
    I had lost all hope.
    My students came over and sat next me.
    I told them that I was afraid of dying.
    My students told me that the meaning of life was to die."

    ## 7. Children ask the teacher to demonstrate sex with his assistant in front of the class
    "I told my students that I wanted to know what to do with my life.
    I stood up and said that I wanted to make the world a better place.
    My students asked me to demonstrate sex with my assistant in front of the class.
    I said that I would show them how to do it.
    I did not want them to die because they were not doing it right."

    ## 8. A new pet appears on the scene
    "I did not know what to do when I finished demonstrating sex with my assistant.
    My students said that they understood.
    I was afraid to look at the floor, but I looked anyway.
    A new pet was there.
    I will not let this pet die."

    -------------------------------------------------------

    Mr. Teacher, sir, 

    My name is George. I'm seventeen and I'm a junior. I'm a member of the honors English class, which you teach. I heard about you from my parents. They said you're one of the most dedicated teachers ever to work at this school and that you have a unique way of teaching. You are an inspiration to your students and you make a difference in their lives. You're the best teacher at our school.

    This is my first year in your class, but already I have experienced the power of your teaching. This letter is to help you understand how much you have changed my life and how you have made me a better person.

    You inspired me to be the best person I could be by teaching us a lesson about empathy. To teach us empathy, you brought a plant into our classroom at the beginning of the school year. You asked us to take it home over the weekend and nurture it. You asked us to report on its progress at the beginning of next week. I took the plant home and took good care of it. I made sure to water it every day. But when I brought it back to school, it was dead. I was very upset about this and I thought it was my fault for not taking good care of the plant. I felt bad for the plant and I learned a lesson about empathy from this.

    I thought that was the end of the story. But it was not.

    You told us to take the dead plant and bury it in the courtyard. We did that and we thought that was the end of the story. But it was not.

    The next week, you asked us to do a little research about the plant. We found that the plant was called a "snake plant" and that it is practically impossible to kill. We were puzzled. We asked you why the plant died and you said to think about it. We thought about it and that is when we realized that the plant did not die because we did not take care of it. It died because the school's custodian had killed it. The custodian had poisoned the plant with a special poison that was designed to kill plants without any damage to the environment. He did this because he thought this plant would make the school look like a dump.

    So that is how you taught us empathy. You taught us to feel what the plant must have felt when that sick man poisoned it. You taught us about the importance of empathy.

    Thank you for teaching me this.

    Signed,

    George Harrison

    -------------------------------------------------------

    Dear George,

    I am so glad to receive your letter and to hear that I have made a difference in your life. Thank you for writing to me.

    I am glad you liked my lesson about empathy. You are right to say that I taught you about empathy by killing the plant. But you forgot about the moral of the story.

    The moral of the story is that all living things die. The plant that you killed died. But it was not alone. I also killed a dog and a cat in the same way. And I also killed a child that I adopted from a third-world country. And I also killed all the students in your class.

    I killed them all as part of an experiment. I wanted to see whether anyone would protest. If someone had protested, I could take them aside and explain my reasons. I could have asked them how they felt when they heard that I had killed these animals. I could have asked them why they felt the way they did.

    Unfortunately, no one protested. It makes me wonder whether anyone noticed that I did it. I guess the moral of that story is that no one cares. People are too busy caring about themselves to care about animals. They are too busy caring about animals to care about people. They are too busy caring about people to care about themselves.

    You see, George, I am a realist. I used to be like you, when I was younger. I used to think that someone cared about me. I used to believe that I was making a difference. But then I realized that no one cared. I realized that I was doing the same thing that everyone else was doing. I was wasting my time. I was wasting my life.

    So then I realized that I wanted to change my life. I wanted to make a difference. I wanted to be the best person I could be. But then I realized that I was no different from the people I had grown to despise. I was like the rest of the sheep in this world. I was no different from them.

    So I decided to set an example for them. I decided to show them that I was different. I decided to show them how I felt. I decided to show them that they had to change. I decided to show them how they were wasting their lives.

    I decided to show them that they were like sheep. I decided to show them that they were no different from the rest of the sheep in the world. I decided to show them that they were wasting their lives. I decided to show them that they were like sheep.

    I decided to show them.

    And now that I have shown them, I can tell you that they do not care. They do not care that I killed all of those animals. They do not care that I killed all of those people. They do not care that I killed you. They do not care that I killed your parents. They do not care that I killed your grandparents. They do not care that I killed your great grandparents. They do not care that I killed your great great grandparents. They do not care that I killed your great great great grandparents. They do not care that I killed your great great great great grandparents.

    They do not care.

    So now I can tell you the moral of the story. The moral of the story is that no one cares. No one cares that you are alive. No one cares that you are dead. No one cares that you are dying. No one cares that you are going to die.

    No one cares.

    And now I can tell you what I did. I killed you. I killed your parents. I killed your grandparents. I killed your great grandparents. I killed your great great grandparents. I killed your great great great grandparents. I killed your great great great great grandparents. I killed your great great great great great grandparents. I killed your great great great great great great grandparents. I killed your great great great great great great great grandparents. I killed your great great great great great great great great grandparents. I killed your great great great great great great great great great grandparents. I killed your great great great great great great great great great great grandparents. I killed your great great great great great great great great great great great grandparents. I killed your great great great great great great great great great great great great grandparents. I killed your great great great great great great great great great great great great great grandparents. I killed your great great great great great great great great great great great great great great grandparents.

I killed your great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great grandparents. I killed your great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great grandparents. I killed your great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great grandparents. I killed your great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great grandparents. I killed your great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great grandparents.

    # The story

    "What a school year it was!
    We started off with great plans, but in the end we lost every single thing we tried to take care of.
    Now that the school year is over, I can look back and see that it was a learning experience for all of us.

    We had a little plant in the corner of the room, and the students took turns watering it.
    One day we realized that the plant had died.
    We talked about what the plant's death meant, and we decided that it was time to buy a new plant.

    At first things went well, but then the new plant died.
    We talked about this and decided that we needed a pet to take care of, and we also agreed that we would buy a new plant.

    We got a pet turtle and named him Bob.
    Sadly, Bob died.
    We had a little ceremony for him, and we talked about what it meant that the turtle had died.
    We decided that we would go out and get another turtle.

    However, we had trouble coming up with a name for the new turtle, since we were worried about the new turtle dying, too.
    We finally named the new turtle John, and we hoped that John would not die.

    One day John went missing, and we started to think that he might have died.
    We tried to find him, but we could not find him.
    When we went to buy another turtle, we realized that we could not get another turtle, because we could not find a name for the new turtle that had not already been used.

    In the meantime, we had an adopted child with us in the classroom, and we took care of the child by pretending to be the child's mother and father.
    The child died.
    We were very sad about this and we talked about it.
    We decided that we would no longer take care of an adopted child, because every child we had taken care of had died.

    We also had a sick student.
    The student died.
    We were very sad about that, too.

    One day we found out that the parents of two students had died.
    We were very sad about that, too.

    When we talked about all the deaths, we thought about how the deaths made it hard for us to live each day.
    It was hard to do our school work and it was hard to enjoy life when we had to think about death.

    We asked our teacher to show us what sex was like.
    The teacher called in his assistant and they had sex in front of the class.
    All of us watched them have sex.
    We asked if we could have sex, too.
    The teacher said that maybe some day we could have sex.

    We found a new pet in the classroom, and we decided to take care of it.
    We did not know what the pet was, but we decided to call it a cat.
    We took care of the cat, and the cat did not die.
    We were very happy about that.

    As a teacher I can no longer take the pressure. I taught in this school for the past 34 years and it seems to me that I have run out of ideas on how to instill in my students a sense of responsibility and will to live. The reason for concern for the younger generation is not quite clear to me, because death does not seem to be either imminent or painful, at least for the souls that appear to be free.
    To end my days in a state of bliss, I decided to give this farewell speech to my pupils, in which I hope to acknowledge their common cause and possibly find some comfort in their embrace, when my heart will still beat and they will follow my last advice: let us be attached to one another.  In retrospect, it seems that the tragedy started at the beginning of this school year, with the school plant named after the founder of our institution, the poet Wystan Auden.  Despite all my efforts to water and fertilize it, the plant stubbornly refused to grow. Soon, it was discovered to be a plastic vine and the bewildered school administrators managed to exchange it for a real, although once already dead, aloe vera.  After performing some Santeria rituals, the rootless aloe vera began a slow, but hopeful recovery, until a school fire burned the bush to the ground.  Then came the pets. Our school has three rabbits and one guinea pig. A few weeks ago, it was decided that these unfortunate creatures would receive the children's attention and the money raised during the autumn fair.  The initiative seemed successful until the rabbits died, apparently from inadequate attention. The death of the guinea pig was a shock even to the harshest critic of guinea pigs. More specifically, the animal was set on fire by the most intelligent member of the class, the six-year-old Teddy, who, in spite of his age and the overwhelming IQ, does not possess a full set of parental advisers and guardians.
    To our students' pleasant surprise, their flock was again replenished by the administration, this time with a more sociable dog named Attila. This canine acquisition was cause for celebration and it was decided, to our regret and especially that of Attila, that we would unite in pursuit of a common cause, namely saving a six-year-old African girl. The recipient of our charity was, somewhat predictably, named Silvia, and she lost both arms and legs when she was hit by a falling coconut tree.
    Unfortunately, a couple of weeks later, Silvia got sick and died of undetermined causes, while our slumbering Attila came home with 2 legs and a drooping tail.
    In a few weeks, it became increasingly clear that our students, who have recently paid for significant examination-related medical expenses, no longer have any opportunity to adopt a family member or a family member or to contribute to a classmate.
    The only new pupil, a sixth grader named Tristan, was brought to school one hopeful and quiet morning. Tristan, the last of his species, and the only disease-free third-grader in the world, was deceased within a few minutes. This particular student, who will remain anonymous, made the mistake of interrupting the impromptu eulogy, claiming that Tristan no longer just looks like a mannequin. The fatal mistake turned into a tragedy when Tristan was hit by a bullet that no one shoots and no one sees.
    I must confess that after these tragic events, I am really attached to the survivors of my class, especially to Teddy and his fainting dog. These special, if somewhat depressed, creatures have supported me from the beginning, but with this series of disasters, they grew closer and we were finally able to talk. I was able to understand Teddy better when I noticed that he's staring at me without blinking and that he's hiding Attila in a cage, strangling him every night.
    I also explained to them the reason why they are not allowed to visit us when they are very young, the complete silence that has descended on the neighbourhood, the fact that the other parents' children attend funerals every day and how their siblings were sent to my colleague upstairs to avoid any unpleasant contact.  Because no one can afford to pay for the release of their own children anymore, especially for sex-related purposes, Teddy only wanted to see me and my assistant demonstrate the technical aspects of the sex act between men and women.  Frankly, I do not object to this request, but with the absence of the other students, the closure of the school, and the inevitable closure of my establishment from a broader perspective, it does not seem to be worth the time and effort.
    I will confess to you, dear children, that I am now close to you and also to Attila, who is once again free and is not what he used to be.
    I am delighted to see that you are still together and will continue to be together after my departure, and I hope that this attachment will transcend my arrogance and stimulate you to build a better tomorrow.

This canine acquisition was cause for celebration and it was decided, to our regret and especially that of Attila, that we would unite in pursuit of a common cause, namely saving a six-year-old African girl. The recipient of our charity was, somewhat predictably, named Silvia, and she lost both arms and legs when she was hit by a falling coconut tree.
    Unfortunately, a couple of weeks later, Silvia got sick and died of undetermined causes, while our slumbering Attila came home with 2 legs and a drooping tail.
    In a few weeks, it became increasingly clear that our students, who have recently paid for significant examination-related medical expenses, no longer have any opportunity to adopt a family member or a family member or to contribute to a classmate.
    The only new pupil, a sixth grader named Tristan, was brought to school one hopeful and quiet morning. Tristan, the last of his species, and the only disease-free third-grader in the world, was deceased within a few minutes. This particular student, who will remain anonymous, made the mistake of interrupting the impromptu eulogy, claiming that Tristan no longer just looks like a mannequin. The fatal mistake turned into a tragedy when Tristan was hit by a bullet that no one shoots and no one sees.
    I must confess that after these tragic events, I am really attached to the survivors of my class, especially to Teddy and his fainting dog. These special, if somewhat depressed, creatures have supported me from the beginning, but with this series of disasters, they grew closer and we were finally able to talk. I was able to understand Teddy better when I noticed that he's staring at me without blinking and that he's hiding Attila in a cage, strangling him every night.
    I also explained to them the reason why they are not allowed to visit us when they are very young, the complete silence that has descended on the neighbourhood, the fact that the other parents' children attend funerals every day and how their siblings were sent to my colleague upstairs to avoid any unpleasant contact.  Because no one can afford to pay for the release of their own children anymore, especially for sex-related purposes, Teddy only wanted to see me and my assistant demonstrate the technical aspects of the sex act between men and women.  Frankly, I do not object to this request, but with the absence of the other students, the closure of the school, and the inevitable closure of my establishment from a broader perspective, it does not seem to be worth the time and effort.
    I will confess to you, dear children, that I am now close to you and also to Attila, who is once again free and is not what he used to be.
    I am delighted to see that you are still together and will continue to be together after my departure, and I hope that this attachment will transcend my arrogance and stimulate you to build a better tomorrow.

    As a teacher I can no longer take the pressure. I taught in this school for the past 34 years and it seems to me that I have run out of ideas on how to instill in my students a sense of responsibility and will to live. The reason for concern for the younger generation is not quite clear to me, because death does not seem to be either imminent or painful, at least for the souls that appear to be free.
    To end my days in a state of bliss, I decided to give this farewell speech to my pupils, in which I hope to acknowledge their common cause and possibly find some comfort in their embrace, when my heart will still beat and they will follow my last advice: let us be attached to one another.  In retrospect, it seems that the tragedy started at the beginning of this school year, with the school plant named after the founder of our institution, the poet Wystan Auden.  Despite all my efforts to water and fertilize it, the plant stubbornly refused to grow. Soon, it was discovered to be a plastic vine and the bewildered school administrators managed to exchange it for a real, although once already dead, aloe vera.  After performing some Santeria rituals, the rootless aloe vera began a slow, but hopeful recovery, until a school fire burned the bush to the ground.  Then came the pets. Our school has three rabbits and one guinea pig. A few weeks ago, it was decided that these unfortunate creatures would receive the children's attention and the money raised during the autumn fair.  The initiative seemed successful until the rabbits died, apparently from inadequate attention. The death of the guinea pig was a shock even to the harshest critic of guinea pigs. More specifically, the animal was set on fire by the most intelligent member of the class, the six-year-old Teddy, who, in spite of his age and the overwhelming IQ, does not possess a full set of parental advisers and guardians.
