    \t<p class=\"initialPic pTagContainer\">I have no idea if I&apos;d even want answers\

    \n\t<br><br><br>\n\n\t<h2>\n\t\tPart 2: Women in Love -- Do or Die\n\t</h2>\n\t\
    \n\t<p class=\"pTagContainer\">\n\t\tI really think that it is a bit impetuous\
    \ to say that a woman is capable of being in love.\n\t\t\n\t</p>\n\t\n\t<p class=\"\
    pTagContainer\">\n\t\tHave you ever heard of saudade, my friend? Umberto Eco once\
    \ said, \n\t\t<br>\n\t\t&quot;If I say we are men in the process of de-civilizing\
    \ ourselves, I mean we are moving away from saudade.&quot;\n\t\t<br>I don&apos;t\
    \ think people understand what it means to sacrifice the self in the name of love\
    \ by watching a few love movies or reading a few romance novels.\n\t</p>\t\n\n\
    \t<p class=\"pTagContainer\"><span class=\"leadingBegin\">The challenge which\
    \ men face: </span> holding back the ravenous desire for conquest to show mercy\
    \ and grace to a woman. <br>When I remove my mask of an Everyman as some sort\
    \ of trickster in blackface and reveal my true extraordinary self in the world,\
    \ I think I will only be admired by women, not loved, because admiration is not\
    \ love.</p>\n\n\t<p class=\"pTagContainer\"> \n\t\tOn the one hand, I&apos;m the\
    \ type of society woman who chooses roles of the destructive bitch, manipulative\
    \ whore, and emotionally cold adulteress in order to feel loved. \n\t\t<br>But\
    \ fuck that.\n\t</p>\t\n\n\t<p class=\"pTagContainer\"> \n\t\tJustice is just\
    \ a tribute that people pay to the strong and ruthless!\n\t\t<br> And no form\
    \ of mercy or subjugation would ever be sufficient to change that.  \n\t</p>\t\
    \t\n\n\t<p class=\"pTagContainer\">\n\t\t<span class=\"leadingBegin\">So, I ask\
    \ myself: </span> In a more noble pursuit, can I find a type of woman to love\
    \ that does not embarrass me, but rather elevates me?\n\t</p>\t\t\n\n\t<p class=\"\
    pTagContainer\">\n\t\tThe type who will never surrender his soul, even if it means\
    \ destruction in the eyes of society.\n\t</p>\t\n\n\t<p class=\"pTagContainer\"\
    >\n\t\tThat is, his soul, to which I can entrust myself with confidence.\n\t</p>\t\
    \n\n\t<br><br><br>\n\n\t<p class=\"pTagContainer\">\n\t\tI think that if I were\
    \ able to trust such a man, I just may be able to offer him my submission.\n\t\
    </p>\n\t<p class=\"pTagContainer\">\n\t\tBut sadly, I don&apos;t think I&apos;d\
    \ be able to find a man of that character anywhere around me.\n\t</p>\t\n\n\t\
    <p class=\"pTagContainer\">\n\t\tI hope that this confession poured out from my\
    \ soul will be used as evidence in my favor.\n\t</p>\n\n\t<br><br><br>\t\n\n\t\
    <p class=\"pTagContainer\">\n\t\tWill I die or will I overcome my temptations\
    \ before I ruin myself?\n\t</p>\n\n\t<p class=\"pTagContainer\">\n\t\tWill I be\
    \ able to resist the temptation of destroying multiple innocent lives in the name\
    \ of trust, but in reality just malice?\n\t</p>\n\t\n\t<p class=\"pTagContainer\"\
    >\n\t\t<span class=\"leadingBegin\">Can there ever be reincarnation?</span> If\
    \ it exists, then I will be locked behind glass walls like an animal or a beautiful\
    \ child in human form without the given honor of freedom.\n\t</p>\n\n\t<p class=\"\
    pTagContainer\">\n\t\tAs I inspect my face, I must admit that I carry it well.\n\
