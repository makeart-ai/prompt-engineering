    		Part 2: Women in Love -- Do or Die

    	<p class="pTagContainer">
    		I really think that it is a bit impetuous to say that a woman is capable of being in love.
    		
    	</p>
    	
    	<p class="pTagContainer">
    		Have you ever heard of saudade, my friend? Umberto Eco once said, 
    		<br>
    		&quot;If I say we are men in the process of de-civilizing ourselves, I mean we are moving away from saudade.&quot;
    		<br>I don&apos;t think people understand what it means to sacrifice the self in the name of love by watching a few love movies or reading a few romance novels.
    	</p>	

    	<p class="pTagContainer"><span class="leadingBegin">The challenge which men face: </span> holding back the ravenous desire for conquest to show mercy and grace to a woman. <br>When I remove my mask of an Everyman as some sort of trickster in blackface and reveal my true extraordinary self in the world, I think I will only be admired by women, not loved, because admiration is not love.</p>

    	<p class="pTagContainer"> 
    		On the one hand, I&apos;m the type of society woman who chooses roles of the destructive bitch, manipulative whore, and emotionally cold adulteress in order to feel loved. 
    		<br>But fuck that.
    	</p>	

    	<p class="pTagContainer"> 
    		Justice is just a tribute that people pay to the strong and ruthless!
    		<br> And no form of mercy or subjugation would ever be sufficient to change that.  
    	</p>		

    	<p class="pTagContainer">
    		<span class="leadingBegin">So, I ask myself: </span> In a more noble pursuit, can I find a type of woman to love that does not embarrass me, but rather elevates me?
    	</p>		

    	<p class="pTagContainer">
    		The type who will never surrender his soul, even if it means destruction in the eyes of society.
    	</p>	

    	<p class="pTagContainer">
    		That is, his soul, to which I can entrust myself with confidence.
    	</p>	

    	<br><br><br>

    	<p class="pTagContainer">
    		I think that if I were able to trust such a man, I just may be able to offer him my submission.
    	</p>
    	<p class="pTagContainer">
    		But sadly, I don&apos;t think I&apos;d be able to find a man of that character anywhere around me.
    	</p>	

    	<p class="pTagContainer">
    		I hope that this confession poured out from my soul will be used as evidence in my favor.
    	</p>

    	<br><br><br>	

    	<p class="pTagContainer">
    		Will I die or will I overcome my temptations before I ruin myself?
    	</p>

    	<p class="pTagContainer">
    		Will I be able to resist the temptation of destroying multiple innocent lives in the name of trust, but in reality just malice?
    	</p>
    	
    	<p class="pTagContainer">
    		<span class="leadingBegin">Can there ever be reincarnation?</span> If it exists, then I will be locked behind glass walls like an animal or a beautiful child in human form without the given honor of freedom.

    Alex had a close encounter with an UFO a few hours ago.  It was a terribly windy.  The wind was woke me up. I looked out across the landscape, everything all crumpled up in a big storm. Now, I have a nice little house, a log house, set in the valley. Two stories, wonderful view. Very plain, very simple. A kitchen and bath downstairs and two bedrooms upstairs, and a big fireplace. That's it. A mile from me there's a little village. I'm close to both the village and the river. Around the house, decks and a little garden, big oaks, the ground oak trees. In the distance, the lake. It's quite a nice situation. Those  around me know me as a man who lives alone and tends to his own business. I'm a conventional man, they say. conservative, without vices of
    Note. There's nothing particularly dramatic to steal. I don't expect to ever get killed. No dramatic disasters.  I mention this because I had been out in the storm and came back home. I was busy putting away tools and I heard the front entry door open and close.  It was the rain because all the windows and the door was opened. And I was busy trying to close all the doors and shut the windows when I heard something in the living room. I turned around and there was something in the house, in the entrance to the bedroom.  It was a woman.  I didn't know her.  I thought it was something the storm had driven in. I've never seen anything like that before I have no idea where she came from. She was small person and she was radically deformed.  She was naked and wet, the skin all rough and twisted, badly scarred over some parts of the body. Perhaps it was the ugliness of her, me reflex reaction. She was shrieked.  I just moved away. I'm not unnatural.
    I'm not unfeeling.  But this was beyond me. I pay and I went into stairway and closed on a doorway.  But the thing made a sound, sort a cry, and it scared me. It wasn't the noise but her cry that was most startling sudden. I was afraid, because I don't know what it is. I just left my post and ran downstairs. The wine cellar was sort a place where I can wait.  So I was down in the wine cellar and I was sitting on the floor, shook and waiting for something to happen.  Scared. I don't know what I was expecting. Maybe I thought she'd come down, some big horrible giant animal would come down and mask the whole house and maybe eat me, never sure, never knowing. Just waiting. It was very cold in the cellar and I don't have any clothes. I was cold. I remember the pangs of hunger and very conscious that I'll be need to go to the bathroom soon.  Thinking they're small things compared to what could be happening.  I'm waiting there, in the dark.  For nothing.  After a while, everything became very quiet. One can get so ice and afraid, so hungry and desperate, slowly becoming irrational that it's quite some time after nothing happens before you begin to realize what is, in fact, happening: nothing.  I mean, this is unheard of. A strange, sick human woman walks in under the gate, walks into the middle of a storm, looks at me, runs upstairs, enters one of the bedrooms, shuts the door and wait while the place is getting destroyed. It was very logical thing to do.  After all this, I came back to the wine cellar and discovered that a bottle of an expensive gold-colored Chardonnay. I knew this wine had been there a long time, I should have wondered what it was of a very curious substance.  I should have remembered that was magic.  That was a happy fact.  I touch my lips to the magic wine and I felt a strange happiness. The dark cellar fade faded. The fearful possibilities fled. I felt well. I thought, why am I here? I have to keep waiting. Here I have a bottle of the best California gold-colored wine.  As waiting for me alone.  So let them wait, whatever it is upstairs. I started my lunch. The thought of hearing someone coming in to the cellar was seem appealing now.  It would have been to share the wine, but maybe that person would have a few peanuts to share.  I took some time to sip the wine, thinking and considering diferent problem.
    What is it? A monster? An animal? Who or what is it? I put aside the questions.
    I was content and enjoyed by just enjoyment of drinking, not drinking consciously.  Then I put up my head. Something had change.  I couldn't here the rain. It was so dark outside I couldn't see the mountains.  But the rain has stop. For the first time in two weeks, I could feel wind and warmth. The same, strange happiness is threatening me, although everything else around us has remained the same.  No, there was one thing different. I heard birds singing. I just couldn't believe it. I thought that snow had melt, flowers are growing. The who woods lies in spring. The rain still falls and the storm is over.  I am amusing with my bottle of the best California gold-colored wine, just looking the wall of my wine cellar.  I have found a bottle of win and drank it, and I still have some for the second time. It's delicious wine and of a risky delicious. Everything's not bad as seems.  I have a half-bottle of the best Californian gold-colored wine remaining, so I think I'll sit here for a while again. I might cry a few tears but will enjoy my sorrow, the sorrows are the most powerful and instructive sadness, full of the reverberation of years of sighing, there is wisdom in them, it is good to be wise, it is good to be cynical, it is good to know that the tribulations are powerful, it is good to suffer, it is good to laugh, it is good to look at the sky, it is good to work, it is good to sleep, it is good to hope, good to hope, good to hope.

    Sasha was strolling around the forest which was not unlike the Supreme Court of the United States. He looked around for any signs of civilization to no avail. Last time he had lunch with his friends, it was as if time had stopped. Just when despair was about to engulf him, he saw a dim light. He tried to swim upstream toward the hopes to get to the bright light, but lazy fish was not willing to run with the current and was doing some water walk. Sasha did not know how to call them, as at that moment he had some issues thinking straight, so he decided to label them as lizards. Somewhere in the distance he could hear a voice. Which seemed familiar. "Sukina!" - he said to himself before realizing that someone was swearing. Because he was hungry, and because it was easy to catch slow fish, he decided to do it again. The fish might have been fast, but it was lazy, so it did not jump up high enough and fell down into the "pit".

    away from the source they they emerge....

    One from the command line, 
    the other from the RStudio IDE.

    ## first be sure to 

    ```{r}
    setwd('E:\\Users\\AlexC\\Desktop\\statistics_math_computing_coding\\Alex\\intro-2019-11-13\\VladM\\victor_alex_confusion')
    # setwd('E:\\Users\\Alex\\Dropbox\\statistics_math_computing_coding\\Alex\\intro-2019-11-13\\VladM\\victor_alex_confusion')
    # setwd('E:/Users/AlexC/Desktop/statistics_math_computing_coding/Alex/intro-2019-11-13/VladM/victor_alex_confusion')

    system('git pull')

    system('git checkout rstudio')

    system('git branch -D victor')

    setwd('..')

    system('rmdir /Q /S victor_alex_confusion')
    ```


    ## For easier memorization and logic, your branch names should start with your first name, followed by an underscore, and then a one or two word summary of what your branch contains


    ## Now remember how to do this from the command line

    ## observe the original branching from master

    ```{git}
    git branch rstudio
    git branch -a
    git checkout rstudio
    git status
    ```

    ## now we recreate it from scratch, just for good measure

    ```{git}
    git branch -D rstudio
    git branch -a
    git branch rstudio
    git branch -a
    git checkout rstudio
    git status
    git checkout master
    git branch -a
    git branch -m rstudio alex_rstudio
    git branch -a
    ```

    ```{anything else?}
    ```

    ## Now we want separate branches for Victor and Alex

    ```{r}
    system('git branch -D alex_rstudio')
    system('git branch -D master')
    system('git branch -a')
    ```

    ```{git}
    git branch victor
    git branch -a
    git branch alex
    git branch -a
    ```

    ```{r}
    system('git push origin --delete victor')
    system('git push origin --delete alex')
    system('git branch -a')
    ```

    ```{git}
    git checkout victor
    git push
    git status
    git pull
    git checkout alex
    git push
    git status
    git pull
    ```

    ## now we wipe the slate clean, and recreate it totally different

    ```{r}
    system('git branch -D victor')
    system('git branch -D alex')
    system('git branch -a')
    ```

    ## now we wipe the slate clean, and recreate it totally different

    ```{r}
    system('git branch -D victor')
    system('git branch -D alex')
    system('git branch -a')
    ```

    ## yep, seems that the push --delete was needed for the branch to disappear from GitHub web

    ## probably good to just follow directions - delete the remote master and create a fresh new repo that's totally different, instead of creating branches and then deleting them, altering them and adjusting them

    ## I will pull the chain and try it out

    ```{git}
    git checkout -b alex
    git push --set-upstream origin alex
    git status
    git checkout -b victor
    git push
    git status
    git checkout -b victor
    git push -u origin victor
    ```

    ## so I'd better clean this stuff up

    ## do it the way the tutorial directs

    ## first delete the master

    ```{git}
    git branch -D alex

    git branch -D victor

    git checkout -b alex

    git push --set-upstream origin alex

    git status

    git checkout -b victor

    git push

    git status

    git checkout -b victor

    git push -u origin victor
    ```

    ## what a pain in the ass - you can't work with these remotes if they aren't visible on the web

    ## rewrite it more in the voice of alex, but try to bring more humor to the fracas that usually happens wrt git and github

    ## force it with -f, less aggresively get the latest

    ```{git}
    # force it with -f, less aggresively get the latest
    git checkout alex

    git push -f

    git pull -f AlexC/victor_alex_confusion
    ```

    ```{r}
    system('git branch -D alex')
    ```

    ```{git}
    git status
    git checkout -b alex
    git push --set-upstream origin alex
    git status
    git checkout -b victor
    git push
    git status
    git checkout -b victor
    git push -u origin victor
    ```

    ```{r}

    There are several hairs that are growing on my bald head. One of them is getting a bit fat. I am wondering if it is a miniature hamster.

    I was travelling through The Netherlands the other day. I mean. So I was, like.

    Give me your damn hamster and I'll set you free.

    Our number four let us down today. He had an outlet of self-doubt that has occurred in his mind.

    I am imagining a new type of decorative chandelier that would be made of hamsters.

    V.

    The only thing I can think of is tiny hamsters. Tiny hamsters. Tiny hamsters.

    I have noticed that the only thing I can think of are hamsters.

    Hamsters.

    SO I have noticed that. They come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. the smaller ones are often quite talkative. They are having deep philosophical conversations while walking on the sidewalk. Or they are driving on Busses and talking about this sort of thing.

    What sort of thing??

    VI.

    HAMSTERS!

    HAMSTERS!!

    HAMSTERS!!!!

    VII.

    Lalalalalalalala

    VIII.

    I have had a close encounter with an UFO today. An Unidentified Flatlining Object that was coming out of the ground. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking it was really a bad hamster.

    Wasn't it? :)

    IX.

    I stood in the middle of the city and yelled: I LOVE ALL HAMSTERS!

    The silence that followed could be cut with a knife.

    I have just discovered the other day that the front page of the dictionary is called the front page. Thank you. Thank you very much.

    UFOs and human perception
    Alex experienced strange symptoms, such as breathing difficulties, after an encounter with a UFO.
    A majority of the population had similar symptoms, all at the same time.
    After the UFO disspeared they all died.
    The UFO can still be found in the woods, near the city of Amsterdam.

    This is a documentary description of Winston's report. He encountered an UFO two days ago. He tells about the strange feelings in his body, what he noticed about the animals and electric devices.
  "output": |-
    On the evening of September 21, Winston was sitting on his porch when he noticed a strange light in the sky. At first he thought it was a star, but it was moving too fast to be a star. He watched as the light got closer and closer until it was directly over his house. He could see that it was a large, circular object with bright lights around the edge. The object was making a strange humming noise.

    Winston suddenly felt very strange. He felt a tingling sensation all over his body and his heart began to race. He felt like he couldn't breathe. The hair on his arms and legs stood up. He was terrified.

    The object began to move away, and the strange feeling in Winston's body slowly faded. He realized that the animals in his yard had all been acting strangely during the UFO sighting. The dog had been barking wildly and the birds had all flown away. Even the electric lights in his house had dimmed during the sighting.

    Winston is convinced that what he saw was an extraterrestrial spacecraft. He has no explanation for the strange feeling he felt during the sighting, but he is certain that it was caused by the UFO.

  "output": |-
    On the morning of July 2, Winston was driving to work when he spotted an unidentified flying object in the sky. He initially dismissed it as a plane or helicopter, but as he watched it, he realized that it was neither of those things. The object was a strange, floating object that seemed to be made of metal. It was emitting a strange light, and it was moving erratically in the sky. Winston felt a strange sense of dread as he watched the object.

    The next day, Winston began to notice strange things happening around him. The animals in his neighborhood were acting strange, and the electric devices in his home were behaving oddly.

  "output": |-
    Winston was out walking two days ago when he saw something strange in the sky. It was a large, metallic object that he first thought was a plane. But as he watched, it became clear that it was not a plane. It was some kind of unidentified flying object.

    Since that encounter, Winston says he has been feeling strange. His body feels heavy and his head is Foggy. He's also been having trouble sleeping.

    Winston says that the animals in the area around his home seem to be acting strange too. The birds are not singing and the squirrels are not coming out of their hiding places. Even his dog is acting weird, barking at nothing and cowering under the bed.

    Electric devices in Winston's home have also been acting strangely. The lights have been flickering and the television has been turning on and off by itself.

    Although he can't be sure, Winston believes that the UFO he saw was somehow responsible for the strange things that have been happening to him. He says he feels like he is being watched and he can't shake the feeling that something is not right.

    I'll never forget - it was half past midnight, I had just come back from from my pre-slumber constitutional at the park and was making hot chocolate for myself, when I identified a metallic flash in the dark sky.
    I immediately turned on all the lights in my home and looked out of the window as the metallic object hovered over the park right in front of my home.

    A huge chill went down my spine as I suddenly realized that I must have been the only human who had witnessed this. There was no way the residents of this sleepy, sparsely populated neighborhood would have seen it and I wondered who else would have been in the mood for a midnight hot chocolate.

    The next few minutes seemed like a lifetime. I saw the metallic object just hover there and make some alien sounds. The house shook a bit, even my dog was freaking out, barking and cowering under the bed.

    Then, almost as abruptly as it had appeared, it just flew away. 

    I had a strange feeling in my head, my body was feeling heavy, my limbs felt weak. All the animals in the area around seemed to have just freaked out, I would later learn that the birds were not singing and the squirrels had not come out of their hiding places.

    I turned on the TV, but it kept flickering and enough of it came on to show me a message I never imagined I'd see - 'Apologies for the disturbance, you are safe.'. I must've lost my temper and thrown the remote at the TV because the next thing I remember is coming out of a concussion to find myself sprawled out on the floor.

    I still feel like someone was watching me and I can't shake the feeling that there is no escape, that something is not right.

    It was half past midnight, I had just came back from from my pre-slumber walk at the park - hot chocolate in one hand, my dog Tabi by my side, my Parka fitting me like a glove as it always does.
    I'd just shut the door and was turning on the lights, when my eyes caught a flash in the sky. My eyes had to be deceiving me; a streak of light so intense that it could have been a shooting star....I looked up, my eyes struggling against the sparkling lights and identified a metallic flash in the dark sky. I immediately turned on all the lights in my home and looked out of the window, which faced the park, as the metallic object hovered over it. A huge chill went down my spine as I realized that there was no way, literally no one in the neighbourhood had seen this but me. Everyone who could see this at that time of night would have been in bed. The next few minutes seemed like a lifetime. Dogs were barking, some were running amok on the streets, some were whining in fear. I saw the metallic object just hover there and make some alien sounds. The house was shaking, even my dog was freaking out, barking and cowering under the bed.

    I had my hand on the kitchen counter, which was just next to the window, I could feel vibrations from it. I thought I was going to pass out when I realized that everything was happening in slow motion, it felt as if my life was being played out before me and it made everything look so unreal. Then, almost as abruptly as it had appeared, it just flew away.

    I had a strange feeling in my head, my body was feeling heavy, my limbs felt weak but I could feel my eyes getting wet out of emotion and I kept closing them, only thinking of one thing - are they done? Are they done with me?

    I turned on the TV, but it kept flickering, the electric grid was damaged, my petit fours in the fridge were going to get spoiled - and then it came on, a message I never imagined I'd ever see on the TV - "Apologies for the disturbance, you are safe." I must've lost my temper and thrown the remote at the TV because the last thing I remember was the feeling of being jolted by a powerful force, my body hurting to complete oblivion and everything going pitch black for me.

    When I woke up, I was sprawled out on the floor. The world's lights were beating down on me and my neck hurt. I slowly tried to move, much to my relief, everything was in place and it was just my head that hurt a lot. I tried to stand up, I made it but I still felt like someone was watching me and I can't shake the feeling that there is no escape, that something is not right.

    I turned on the TV, but it kept flickering and enough of it came on to show me a message I never imagined I'd see - "Apologies for the disturbance, you are safe. Here are your weekly summary and our American breakfast recipe of the day." I must've lost my temper and thrown the remote at the TV because the last thing I remember was the feeling of being jolted by a powerful force, my body hurting to complete oblivion and everything going pitch black for me.
    When I woke up, I was sprawled out on the floor and the world's bright, bright lights beating down on me.
    "Where am I?" is the thought I clearly remember right after that.
    I was in an oddly vague hospital ward with no apparent staff.
    As soon as I had tried to sit up, I immediately felt an energy of some sort keeping me down - as if I was being made to feel that I was in some otherworldly flying ship, someone gently but mentally restraining me from my futile efforts to get out of bed.
    I scanned the room for some reason for the TV remote - there was no TV in sight in the room, but after some digging around I saw the remote by the foot of my bed.
    I pressed the volume button once and suddenly, the same voice I heard after being jolted in my own home was back with more intensity than ever -
    "We are so sorry for your discomfort, we promise you will know why you were chosen. 
    Our dear friend, you have a very ingenious mind that is so ripe for learning. 
    Even though you have now been brought here, you are still safe, you are healthy and we promise you that we haven't mucked up anything. 
    You may have lost your home, your loved ones and your free will but you are so very fortunate to be a part of a mission greater than anything you have ever imagined. 
    You get your options to choose what you want to be. 
    Do you have a job to do while on Earth? Was there a particular family member you used to always hate? 
    We can fix it all now and help you lead the life you were always meant to. 
    At the sound of these words, we promise you will feel bright."
    I snapped out of my reverie and did not put that distant voice in my head back in the "To be heard later" basket. 
    Instead I took it for what it was - a very frightening promise to give me something back for all my losses. 
    What had I to lose? Indeed. 
    "I'm all yours then," I said to myself, with a sad realization slowly crawling into my heart that whatever had happened was already in the past and I now had the opportunity to start anew, in the loving arms of my newfound family. 
    The TV that had no remotes turned back on the news channel. 
    "News just in, the world's greatest scientist, responsible for many major discoveries ever since the year 1984 has backed out of the worldwide conference to be held this week. 
    We give credit to his recent illness and hope to see him back in his feet soon. 
    Stay tuned for the latest developments" 
    - I heard the news anchor say.

    I'll never forget - it was half past midnight and I had just come back from from my pre-slumber walk at the park.
    Ever since my wife would left me two years ago, I had found myself indulging in my two passions - astronomy and hot chocolate.
    It was only natural, therefore, that I always looked at the sky before getting my daily hot chocolate fix.
    I turned on the telescope mounted on my balcony and, lo and behold, I identified a metallic flash in the dark sky.
    I immediately knew that this was the object of the century.
    I turned on all the lights in my home and looked out of the window as the metallic object hovered over the park right in front of my home.
    A huge chill went down my spine as I suddenly realized that I must have been the only human who had witnessed this. There was no way the residents of this sleepy, sparsely populated neighborhood would have seen it and I wondered who else would have been in the mood for a midnight hot chocolate.
    The next few minutes seemed like a lifetime. I saw the metallic object just hover there and make some alien sounds. The house shook a bit, even my dog was freaking out, barking and cowering under the bed.
    Then, almost as abruptly as it had appeared, it just flew away. 
    I had a strange feeling in my head, my body was feeling heavy, my limbs felt weak.

    MY THEORY - He was trapped in hyperspace against his will, as a dynamic prisoner. A scientist did an experiment using subjective art, as an alternative to more conventional torture techniques. What our protagonist didn't realize is that his concept of time was warped in the process. His star-gazing is the key to this.

    PROBLEMS - I'm not sure how to navigate the use of mental jolts. Will I end up alienating several of my readers from the story? Also, I need to do some background reading before I can keep the voice authentic.

    I was in an empty, narrow, windowless room with a mirror, a shower and all the requisites you might need to freshen up when you get out of a hospital. I looked at myself in the mirror and tried to clean up and regain some control over myself. I didn't think I looked much different - but when I stumbled out of the room towards what seemed like a cafeteria area, still being directed by the voice, I saw many faces that looked exactly like mine. A really uneasy feeling crawled all over me as I tried to etch this out of my mind in a way that I would be able to laugh it off when I went back home the next day.
    I sat at the table and three plates of piping hot breakfast appeared on the table - a plate with cereals, a plate with hash browns and a plate with a glass of orange juice and a whole deviled egg with a toothpick: the American breakfast. I hungrily had at all three plates and unlike the heavy, tomato-y and bacon-y breakfast I usually am used to: today I was just absolutely delighted.

    # A Flash of the Sky

    I know I'll never forget this night - it was half past midnight and I had just come back from from my pre-slumber walk at the park.
    Ever since my wife would left me two years ago, I had found myself indulging in my two passions - astronomy and hot chocolate.
    It was only natural, therefore, that I always looked at the sky before getting my daily hot chocolate fix.
    I turned on the telescope mounted on my balcony and, lo and behold, I identified a metallic flash in the dark sky.
    I immediately knew that this was the object of the century.
    I turned on all the lights in my home and looked out of the window as the metallic object hovered over the park right in front of my home.
    A huge chill went down my spine as I suddenly realized that I must have been the only human who had witnessed this. There was no way the residents of this sleepy, sparsely populated neighborhood would have seen it and I wondered who else would have been in the mood for a midnight hot chocolate.
    The next few minutes seemed like a lifetime. I saw the metallic object just hover there and make some alien sounds. The house shook a bit, my dog was freaking out, barking and cowering under the bed.
    Then, almost as abruptly as it had appeared, it just flew away. 
    I had a strange feeling in my head, my body was feeling heavy, my limbs felt weak.
    I turned on the TV, but it kept flickering and enough of it came on to show me a message I never imagined I'd see - "Apologies for the disturbance, you are safe. Here are your weekly summary and our American breakfast recipe of the day." I must've lost my temper and thrown the remote at the TV because the last thing I remember was the feeling of being jolted by a powerful force, my body hurting to complete oblivion and everything going pitch black for me.
    When I woke up, I was sprawled out on the floor and the world's bright, bright lights beating down on me.
    "Where am I?" is the thought I clearly remember right after that.
    I was in an oddly vague hospital ward with no apparent staff.
    As soon as I had tried to sit up, I immediately felt an energy of some sort keeping me down - I was jolted with a memory of an invisible hand touching my head to gently but mentally restrain me from futile efforts to get out of bed.
    I scanned the room for some reason for the TV remote - there was no TV in sight in the room, but after some digging around I saw the remote by the foot of my bed. I pressed the volume button once and suddenly, the same voice I heard after being jolted in my own home was back with more intensity than ever -
    "We are so sorry for your discomfort, we promise you will know why you were chosen. 
    "Our dear friend, you have such a ripe imagination. Even though you have now been brought here, you are still safe, you are healthy and we promise you that we haven't mucked up anything. You may have lost your home, your loved ones and your free will but you are so very fortunate that you chose to be a part of a mission greater than anything you have ever imagined. We will help you lead the life that you were always meant to. At the sound of these words, we promise you will feel bright."
    I didn't feel bright at all. I felt a compulsion to get up, brush my teeth, put on the clothes I was about to put on and get out of the room. As I left the room, I again had a sense that it wasn't me who was in control of my movement, who was responding to what the voice told me to do. The voice yammered on, but I was too disturbed to heed anything of it, given it was minutes after I realized I'd been kidnapped.
    I was in an empty, narrow, windowless room with a mirror, a shower and all the requisites you might need to freshen up when you get out of a hospital. I looked at myself in the mirror and tried to clean up and regain some control over myself. I didn't think I looked much different - but when I stumbled out of the room towards what seemed like a cafeteria area, still being directed by the voice, I saw many faces that looked exactly like mine. A really uneasy feeling crawled all over me as I tried to etch this out of my mind in a way that I would be able to laugh it off when I went back home the next day.
    I sat at the table and three plates of piping hot breakfast appeared on the table - a plate with cereals, a plate with hash browns and a plate with a glass of orange juice and a whole deviled egg with a toothpick: the American breakfast. I hungrily had at all three plates and unlike the heavy, tomato-y and bacon-y breakfast I usually am used to: today I was just absolutely delighted.
